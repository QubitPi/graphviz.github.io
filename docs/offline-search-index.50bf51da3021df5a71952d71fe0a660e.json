[{"body":"Graph Visualization Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. Automatic graph drawing has many important applications in software engineering, database and web design, networking, and in visual interfaces for many other domains.\nGraphviz is open source graph visualization software. It has several main graph layout programs. See the Gallery for some sample layouts. It also has web and interactive graphical interfaces, and auxiliary tools, libraries, and language bindings.\nThe Mac OS X edition of Graphviz, by Glen Low, won two 2004 Apple Design Awards.\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in several useful formats such as images and SVG for web pages, Postscript for inclusion in PDF or other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. (Graphviz also supports GXL, an XML dialect.)\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nIn practice, graphs are usually generated from an external data sources, but they can also be created and edited manually, either as raw text files or within a graphical editor. (Graphviz was not intended to be a Visio replacement, so it is probably frustrating to try to use it that way.)\nViewers tcldot - a TCL/TK scripting language extension for Graphviz Webdot - a tcldot scripted WWW service for graphs in HTML documents.

Note also that the allowed compass point values are not keywords, so these strings can be used elsewhere as ordinary identifiers and, conversely, the parser will actually accept any identifier.\nAn ID is one of the following:\nAny string of alphabetic ([a-zA-Z\\200-\\377]) characters, underscores ('_') or digits([0-9]), not beginning with a digit; a numeral [-]?(.[0-9]⁺ | [0-9]⁺(.[0-9]*)? ); any double-quoted string (\"...\") possibly containing escaped quotes (\\\")¹; an HTML string (\u003c...\u003e). An ID is just a string; the lack of quote characters in the first two forms is just for simplicity. There is no semantic difference between abc_2 and \"abc_2\", or between 2.34 and \"2.34\". Obviously, to use a keyword as an ID, it must be quoted. Note that, in HTML strings, angle brackets must occur in matched pairs, and newlines and other formatting whitespace characters are allowed. In addition, the content must be legal XML, so that the special XML escape sequences for \", \u0026, \u003c, and \u003e may be necessary in order to embed these characters in attribute values or raw text. As an ID, an HTML string can be any legal XML string. However, if used as a label attribute, it is interpreted specially and must follow the syntax for HTML-like labels.\nBoth quoted strings and HTML strings are scanned as a unit, so any embedded comments will be treated as part of the strings.\nAn edgeop is -\u003e in directed graphs and -- in undirected graphs.\nThe language supports C++-style comments: /* */ and //. In addition, a line beginning with a '#' character is considered a line output from a C preprocessor (e.g., # 34 to indicate line 34 ) and discarded.\nSemicolons and commas aid readability but are not required. Also, any amount of whitespace may be inserted between terminals.\nAs another aid for readability, dot allows double-quoted strings to span multiple physical lines using the standard C convention of a backslash immediately preceding a newline character². In addition, double-quoted strings can be concatenated using a '+' operator. As HTML strings can contain newline characters, which are used solely for formatting, the language does not allow escaped newlines or concatenation operators to be used within them.\nSubgraphs and Clusters Subgraphs play three roles in Graphviz. First, a subgraph can be used to represent graph structure, indicating that certain nodes and edges should be grouped together. This is the usual role for subgraphs and typically specifies semantic information about the graph components. It can also provide a convenient shorthand for edges. An edge statement allows a subgraph on both the left and right sides of the edge operator. When this occurs, an edge is created from every node on the left to every node on the right. For example, the specification\nA -\u003e {B C} is equivalent to\nA -\u003e B A -\u003e C In the second role, a subgraph can provide a context for setting attributes. For example, a subgraph could specify that blue is the default color for all nodes defined in it. In the context of graph drawing, a more interesting example is:\nsubgraph { rank = same; A; B; C; } This (anonymous) subgraph specifies that the nodes A, B and C should all be placed on the same rank if drawn using dot.\nThe third role for subgraphs directly involves how the graph will be laid out by certain layout engines. If the name of the subgraph begins with cluster, Graphviz notes the subgraph as a special cluster subgraph. If supported, the layout engine will do the layout so that the nodes belonging to the cluster are drawn together, with the entire drawing of the cluster contained within a bounding rectangle. Note that, for good and bad, cluster subgraphs are not part of the DOT language, but solely a syntactic convention adhered to by certain of the layout engines.\nLexical and Semantic Notes A graph must be specified as either a digraph or a graph. Semantically, this indicates whether or not there is a natural direction from one of the edge's nodes to the other. Lexically, a digraph must specify an edge using the edge operator -\u003e while a undirected graph must use --. Operationally, the distinction is used to define different default rendering attributes. For example, edges in a digraph will be drawn, by default, with an arrowhead pointing to the head node. For ordinary graphs, edges are drawn without any arrowheads by default.\nA graph may also be described as strict. This forbids the creation of multi-edges, i.e., there can be at most one edge with a given tail node and head node in the directed case. For undirected graphs, there can be at most one edge connected to the same two nodes. Subsequent edge statements using the same two nodes will identify the edge with the previously defined one and apply any attributes given in the edge statement. For example, the graph\nstrict graph { a -- b a -- b b -- a [color=blue] } will have a single edge connecting nodes a and b, whose color is blue.\nIf a default attribute is defined using a node, edge, or graph statement, or by an attribute assignment not attached to a node or edge, any object of the appropriate type defined afterwards will inherit this attribute value. This holds until the default attribute is set to a new value, from which point the new value is used. Objects defined before a default attribute is set will have an empty string value attached to the attribute once the default attribute definition is made.\nNote, in particular, that a subgraph receives the attribute settings of its parent graph at the time of its definition. This can be useful; for example, one can assign a font to the root graph and all subgraphs will also use the font. For some attributes, however, this property is undesirable. If one attaches a label to the root graph, it is probably not the desired effect to have the label used by all subgraphs. Rather than listing the graph attribute at the top of the graph, and the resetting the attribute as needed in the subgraphs, one can simply defer the attribute definition in the graph until the appropriate subgraphs have been defined.\nIf an edge belongs to a cluster, its endpoints belong to that cluster. Thus, where you put an edge can effect a layout, as clusters are sometimes laid out recursively.\nThere are certain restrictions on subgraphs and clusters. First, at present, the names of a graph and it subgraphs share the same namespace. Thus, each subgraph must have a unique name. Second, although nodes can belong to any number of subgraphs, it is assumed clusters form a strict hierarchy when viewed as subsets of nodes and edges.\nCharacter encodings The DOT language assumes at least the ASCII character set. Quoted strings, both ordinary and HTML-like, may contain non-ASCII characters. In most cases, these strings are uninterpreted: they simply serve as unique identifiers or values passed through untouched. Labels, however, are meant to be displayed, which requires that the software be able to compute the size of the text and determine the appropriate glyphs. For this, it needs to know what character encoding is used.\nBy default, DOT assumes the UTF-8 character encoding. It also accepts the Latin1 (ISO-8859-1) character set, assuming the input graph uses the charset attribute to specify this. For graphs using other character sets, there are usually programs, such as iconv, which will translate from one character set to another.\nAnother way to avoid non-ASCII characters in labels is to use HTML entities for special characters. During label evaluation, these entities are translated into the underlying character. This table shows the supported entities, with their Unicode value, a typical glyph, and the HTML entity name. Thus, to include a lower-case Greek beta into a string, one can use the ASCII sequence \u0026beta;. In general, one should only use entities that are allowed in the output character set, and for which there is a glyph in the font.\nIn quoted strings in DOT, the only escaped character is double-quote \". That is, in quoted strings, the dyad \\\" is converted to \"; all other characters are left unchanged. In particular, \\\\ remains \\\\. Layout engines may apply additional escape sequences. Previous to 2.30, the language allowed escaped newlines to be used anywhere outside of HTML strings. The new lex-based scanner makes this difficult to implement. Given the perceived lack of usefulness of this generality, we have restricted this feature to double-quoted strings, where it can actually be helpful.

For example:\n$ echo 'digraph { a -\u003e b }' | dot -Tsvg \u003e output.svg Generates:\nFlags -Gname[=value] Set a graph attribute, with default value = true\nFor example,\n$ echo 'digraph { a -\u003e b }' | dot -Tsvg -Gfontcolor=red -Glabel=\"My favorite letters\" Overrides the default fontcolor and label attributes of the graph, producing a red legend:\n-Nname[=value] Set a default node attribute, with default value = true.\nFor example,\n$ echo 'digraph { a -\u003e b }' | dot -Tsvg -Nfontcolor=red -Nshape=rect Overrides the default node fontcolor and shape attributes, producing rectangular nodes with red text:\n-Ename[=value] Set a default edge attribute, with default value = true.\nFor example,\n$ echo 'digraph { a -\u003e b }' | dot -Tsvg -Ecolor=red -Earrowhead=diamond Overrides the default edge color and arrowhead attributes, producing red edges with a diamond arrowhead:\n-Klayout Specifies which default layout engine to use, overriding the default from the command name. For example, running dot -Kneato is equivalent to running neato.\n-Tformat[:renderer[:formatter]] Set output language to one of the supported formats. By default, attributed dot is produced.\nDepending on how Graphviz was built, there may be multiple renderers for generating a particular output format, and multiple formatters for creating the final output. For example, a typical installation can produce PNG output using either the Cairo or GD library. The desired rendering engine can be specified after a colon. If there are multiple formatting engines available, the desired one can be specified in a similar fashion after the rendering engine. Thus, -Tpng:cairo specifies PNG output produced by Cairo (using the Cairo's default formatter), and -Tpng:cairo:gd specifies PNG output produced by Cairo formatted using the GD library.\nIf no renderer is specified, or a renderer but no formatter, the default one is invoked. The flag -Tformat: produces a list of all of the renderers available for the specified format, the first one listed with a prefix matching format being the default. Using the -v flag, described below, will print which format, renderer, and formatter are actually used.\n-V Emit version information and exit. For example:\n$ dot -V dot - graphviz version 2.47.1 (20210417.1919) -llibrary User-supplied, device-dependent library text. Multiple flags may be given. These strings are passed to the code generator at the beginning of output.\nFor PostScript output, they are treated as file names whose content will be included in the preamble after the standard preamble. If library is the empty string \"\", the standard preamble is not emitted.\n-n[num] Sets no-op flag in neato. If set, neato assumes nodes have already been positioned and all nodes have a pos attribute giving the positions. It then performs an optional adjustment to remove node-node overlap, depending on the value of the overlap attribute, computes the edge layouts, depending on the value of the splines attribute, and emits the graph in the appropriate format. If num is supplied, the following actions occur:\nnum = 1 Equivalent to -n. num \u003e 1 Use node positions as specified, with no adjustment to remove node-node overlaps, and use any edge layouts already specified by the pos attribute. neato computes an edge layout for any edge that does not have a pos attribute. As usual, edge layout is guided by the splines attribute. -ooutfile Write output to file outfile. For example,\n$ echo 'digraph { a -\u003e b }' | dot -Tsvg -o output.svg Generates output.svg:\nBy default, output goes to stdout.\n-O Automatically generate output file names based on the input file name and the various output formats specified by the -T flags.\nFor example,\n$ dot -Tsvg -O ~/family.dot ~/debug.dot Generates ~/family.dot.svg and ~/debug.dot.svg files.\n-P Automatically generate a graph that shows the plugin configuration of the current executable. e.g.\n$ dot -P -Tsvg -o plugins.svg -q Suppress warning messages.\n-s[scale] Set input scale to scale. If this value is omitted, 72.0 is used. This number is used to convert the point coordinate units used in the pos attribute into inches, which is what is expected by neato and fdp. Thus, feeding the output of a graph laid out by one program into neato or fdp almost always requires this flag. Ignored if the -n flag is used.\n-v Verbose mode\n-x In neato, on input, prune isolated nodes and peninsulas. This removes uninteresting graph structure and produces a less cluttered drawing.\n-y By default, the coordinate system used in generic output formats, such as attributed dot, extended dot, plain and plain-ext, is the standard cartesian system with the origin in the lower left corner, and with increasing y coordinates as points move from bottom to top. If the -y flag is used, the coordinate system is inverted, so that increasing values of y correspond to movement from top to bottom.\n-? Print usage information, then exit.\nIf multiple -T flags are given, drawings of the graph are emitted in each of the specified formats. Multiple -o flags can be used to specify the output file for each format. If there are more formats than files, the remaining formats are written to stdout.\nNote that the -G, -N and -E flags override any initial attribute declarations in the input graph, i.e., those attribute statements appearing before any node, edge or subgraph definitions. In addition, these flags cause the related attributes to be permanently attached to the graph. Thus, if attributed dot is used for output, the graph will have these attributes.\nEnvironment Variables GDFONTPATH List of pathnames giving directories which a program should search for fonts.

To see what formats dot supports, run dot -T?. See the description of the -T flag for additional information.\nNote that the internal coordinate system has the origin in the lower left corner. Thus, positions in the canon, dot, xdot, plain, and plain-ext formats need to be interpreted in this manner.\nImage Formats The image and shapefile attributes specify an image file to be included as part of the final diagram. Not all image formats can be read. In addition, even if read, not all image formats can necessarily be used in a given output format.\nThe graph below shows what image formats can be used in which output formats, and the required plugins. On the left are the supported image formats. On the right are the supported output formats. In the middle are the plugins: image loaders, renderers, drivers, arranged by plugin library. This presents the most general case. A given installation may not provide one of the plugins, in which case, that transformation is not possible.\nID Output Note In the formats: -Tcmap, -Tcmapx, -Tsvg, -Tvml, the output generates id=\"node#\" properties for nodes, id=\"edge#\" properties for edges, and id=\"cluster#\" properties for clusters, with the # replaced by an internally assigned integer. These strings can be provided instead by an externally provided id=xxx attribute on the object. Normal \\N \\E \\G substitutions are applied. Externally provided id values are not used internally, and it is the user's reponsibilty to ensure that they are sufficiently unique for their intended downstream use. Note, in particular, that \\E is not a unique id for multiedges.\n","categories":"","description":"Various graphic and data formats for end user, [web](/gallery), documents and other applications.","excerpt":"Various graphic and data formats for end user, [web](/gallery), …","ref":"/docs/outputs/","tags":"","title":"Output Formats"},{"body":"The table below describes the attributes used by various Graphviz tools. The table gives the name of the attribute, the graph components (node, edge, etc.) which use the attribute and the type of the attribute (strings representing legal values of that type). Where applicable, the table also gives a default value for the attribute, a minimum allowed setting for numeric attributes, and certain restrictions on the use of the attribute.\nNote that attribute names are case-sensitive. This is usually true for attribute values as well, unless noted.\nAll Graphviz attributes are specified by name-value pairs. Thus, to set the color of a node abc, one would use\ndigraph { abc [color = red] } Edit in Playground Similarly, to set the arrowhead style of an edge abc -\u003e def, one would use:\ndigraph { abc -\u003e def [arrowhead = diamond] } Edit in Playground Further details concerning the setting of attributes can be found in the description of the DOT language.\nAt present, most device-independent units are either inches or points, which we take as 72 points per inch.\nNote: Some attributes, such as dir or arrowtail, are ambiguous when used in DOT with an undirected graph since the head and tail of an edge are meaningless. As a convention, the first time an undirected edge appears, the DOT parser will assign the left node as the tail node and the right node as the head. For example, the edge A -- B will have tail A and head B. It is the user's responsibility to handle such edges consistently. If the edge appears later, in the format\ngraph { B -- A [taillabel = \"tail\"] } Edit in Playground the drawing will attach the tail label to node A. To avoid possible confusion when such attributes are required, the user is encouraged to use a directed graph. If it is important to make the graph appear undirected, this can be done using the dir, arrowtail or arrowhead attributes.\nThe tools accept standard C representations for int and double types. For the bool type, TRUE values are represented by true or yes (case-insensitive) and any non-zero integer, and FALSE values by false or no (case-insensitive) and zero. In addition, there are a variety of specialized types such as arrowType, color, point and rankdir. Legal values for these types are given at the end.\nThe Used By column field indicates which graph component(s) the attribute applies to.\nIn the Notes field, an annotation of write only indicates that the attribute is used for output, and is not used or read by any of the layout programs.\n","categories":"","description":"Instructions to customise the layout of Graphviz [nodes](/docs/nodes), [edges](/docs/edges), [graphs](/docs/graph), subgraphs, and [clusters](/docs/clusters).","excerpt":"Instructions to customise the layout of Graphviz [nodes](/docs/nodes), …","ref":"/doc/info/attrs.html","tags":"","title":"Attributes"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/documentation/","tags":"","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"sfdp is a fast, multilevel, force-directed algorithm that efficiently layouts large graphs, outlined in \"Efficient and High Quality Force-Dircted Graph Drawing\"1.\nMultiscale version of the fdp layout, for the layout of large graphs.\nPDF Manual Browse code Attributes for sfdp features beautify – Whether to draw leaf nodes uniformly in a circle around the root node in sfdp..

That is, instead of using shape=record, one might consider using shape=none, margin=0 and an HTML-like label.\nThe geometry and style of all node shapes are affected by the node attributes fixedsize, fontname, fontsize, height, label, style and width.\nPolygon-based Nodes The possible polygon-based shapes are displayed below.\nbox polygon ellipse oval circle point egg triangle plaintext plain diamond trapezium parallelogram house pentagon hexagon septagon octagon doublecircle doubleoctagon tripleoctagon invtriangle invtrapezium invhouse Mdiamond Msquare Mcircle rect rectangle square star none underline cylinder note tab folder box3d component promoter cds terminator utr primersite restrictionsite fivepoverhang threepoverhang noverhang assembly signature insulator ribosite rnastab proteasesite proteinstab rpromoter rarrow larrow lpromoter As the figures suggest, the shapes rect and rectangle are synonyms for box, and none is a synonym for plaintext. The shape plain is similar to these two, except that it also enforces width=0 height=0 margin=0, which guarantees that the actual size of the node is entirely determined by the label. This is useful, for example, when using HTML-like labels. Also, unlike the rest, we have shown these three, as well as underline, without style=filled to indicate the normal use. If fill were turned on, the label text would appear in a filled rectangle.\nThe geometries of polygon-based shapes are also affected by the node attributes regular, peripheries and orientation. If shape=\"polygon\", the attributes sides, skew and distortion are also used. If unset, they default to 4, 0.0 and 0.0, respectively. The point shape is special in that it is only affected by the peripheries, width and height attributes.\nNormally, the size of a node is determined by smallest width and height needed to contain its label and image, if any, with a margin specified by the margin attribute. The width and height must also be at least as large as the sizes specified by the width and height attributes, which specify the minimum values for these parameters. See the fixedsize attribute for ways of restricting the node size. In particular, if fixedsize=shape, the node's shape will be fixed by the width and height attributes, and the shape is used for edge termination, but both the shape and label sizes are used preventing node overlap. For example, the following graph:\ndigraph G { { node [margin=0 fontcolor=blue fontsize=32 width=0.5 shape=circle style=filled] b [fillcolor=yellow fixedsize=true label=\"a very long label\"] d [fixedsize=shape label=\"an even longer label\"] } a -\u003e {c d} b -\u003e {c d} } Edit in Playground yields the figure:\nNote that the label of the yellow node, with fixedsize=true, overlaps the other node, where there is sufficient space for the gray node with fixedsize=shape.\nThe shapes: note, tab, folder, box3d and component were provided by Pander. The synthetic biology shapes: promoter, cds, terminator, utr, primersite, restrictionsite, fivepoverhang, threepoverhang, noverhang, assembly, signature, insulator, ribosite, rnastab, proteasesite, proteinstab, rpromoter, rarrow, larrow and lpromoter were contributed by Jenny Cheng.\nRecord-based Nodes NOTE: Please see the note about record-based nodes. Also note that there are problems using non-trivial edges (edges with ports or labels) between adjacent nodes on the same rank if one or both nodes has a record shape.\nThese are specified by shape values of \"record\" and \"Mrecord\". The structure of a record-based node is determined by its label, which has the following schema:\nrlabel = field ( '|' field )* where field = fieldId or '{' rlabel '}' and fieldId = [ '\u003c' string '\u003e'] [ string ] Braces, vertical bars and angle brackets must be escaped with a backslash character if you wish them to appear as a literal character. Spaces are interpreted as separators between tokens, so they must be escaped if you want spaces in the text.\nThe first string in fieldId assigns a portname to the field and can be combined with the node name to indicate where to attach an edge to the node. (See portPos.) The second string is used as the text for the field; it supports the usual escape sequences \\n, \\l and \\r.\nVisually, a record is a box, with fields represented by alternating rows of horizontal or vertical subboxes. The Mrecord shape is identical to a record shape, except that the outermost box has rounded corners. Flipping between horizontal and vertical layouts is done by nesting fields in braces \"{...}\". The top-level orientation in a record is horizontal. Thus, a record with label \"A | B | C | D\" will have 4 fields oriented left to right, while \"{A | B | C | D}\" will have them from top to bottom and \"A | { B | C } | D\" will have \"B\" over \"C\", with \"A\" to the left and \"D\" to the right of \"B\" and \"C\".\nThe initial orientation of a record node depends on the rankdir attribute. If this attribute is TB (the default) or BT, corresponding to vertical layouts, the top-level fields in a record are displayed horizontally. If, however, this attribute is LR or RL, corresponding to horizontal layouts, the top-level fields are displayed vertically.\nAs an example of a record node, the dot input:\ndigraph structs { node [shape=record]; struct1 [label=\"\u003cf0\u003e left|\u003cf1\u003e mid\u0026#92; dle|\u003cf2\u003e right\"]; struct2 [label=\"\u003cf0\u003e one|\u003cf1\u003e two\"]; struct3 [label=\"hello\u0026#92;nworld |{ b |{c|\u003chere\u003e d|e}| f}| g | h\"]; struct1:f1 -\u003e struct2:f0; struct1:f2 -\u003e struct3:here; } Edit in Playground yields the figure:\nIf we add the line:\nrankdir=LR we get the layout:\nIf we change node struct1 to have shape Mrecord, it then looks like:\nStyles for Nodes The style attribute can be used to modify the appearance of a node. At present, there are 8 style values recognized: filled, invisible, diagonals, rounded. dashed, dotted, solid and bold. As usual, the value of the style attribute can be a comma-separated list of any of these. If the style contains conflicts (e.g, style=\"dotted, solid\"), the last attribute wins.\nfilled This value indicates that the node's interior should be filled. The color used is the node's fillcolor or, if that's not defined, its color. For unfilled nodes, the interior of the node is transparent to whatever color is the current graph or cluster background color. Note that point shapes are always filled. Thus, the code:\ndigraph G { rankdir=LR node [shape=box, color=blue] node1 [style=filled] node2 [style=filled, fillcolor=red] node0 -\u003e node1 -\u003e node2 } Edit in Playground yields the figure:\ninvisible Setting this style causes the node not to be displayed at all. Note that the node is still used in laying out the graph. diagonals The diagonals style causes small chords to be drawn near the vertices of the node's polygon or, in case of circles and ellipses, two chords near the top and the bottom of the shape. The special node shapes Msquare, Mcircle, and Mdiamond are simply an ordinary square, circle and diamond with the diagonals style set. rounded The rounded style causes the polygonal corners to be smoothed. Note that this style also applies to record-based nodes. Indeed, the Mrecord shape is simply shorthand for setting this style. Also, prior to 26 April 2005, the rounded and filled styles were mutually exclusive. As an example of rounding, dot uses the graph:\ndigraph R { rankdir=LR node [style=rounded] node1 [shape=box] node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style=\"rounded,filled\", shape=diamond] node3 [shape=record, label=\"{ a | b | c }\"] node1 -\u003e node2 -\u003e node3 } Edit in Playground to produce the figure:\ndashed This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a dashed line. dotted This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a dotted line. solid This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a solid line, which is the default. bold This style causes the node's border to be drawn as a bold line. See also penwidth. Additional styles may be available with a specific code generator.\nHTML-Like Labels NOTE: This feature is only available on versions of Graphviz that are newer than mid-November 2003. In particular, it is not part of release 1.10.\nNOTE: The font markups for bold, italic, underlining, subscript and superscript (\u003cB\u003e, \u003cI\u003e, \u003cU\u003e, \u003cSUB\u003e and \u003cSUP\u003e) are only available in versions after 14 October 2011, and the markup for strike-through (\u003cS\u003e) requires versions later than 15 September 2013. In addition, all of these markups are currently only available via the cairo and svg renderers. The horizontal and vertical rules (\u003cHR\u003e and \u003cVR\u003e) are only available in versions later than 8 July 2011.\nNOTE: For releases later than 9 September 2014, one can use shape=plain so that the size of the node is totally determined by the label. Otherwise, the node's margin, width and height values may cause the node to be larger, so that edges are clipped away from the label. In effect, shape=plain is shorthand for shape=none width=0 height=0 margin=0.\nIf the value of a label attribute (label for nodes, edges, clusters, and graphs, and the headlabel and taillabel attributes of an edge) is given as an HTML string, that is, delimited by \u003c...\u003e rather than \"...\", the label is interpreted as an HTML description. At their simplest, such labels can describe multiple lines of variously aligned text as provided by ordinary string labels. More generally, the label can specify a table similar to those provided by HTML, with different graphical attributes at each level.\nAs HTML strings are processed like HTML input, any use of the \", \u0026, \u003c, and \u003e characters in literal text or in attribute values need to be replaced by the corresponding escape sequence. For example, if you want to use \u0026 in an href value, this should be represented as \u0026amp;.\nNOTE: The features and syntax supported by these labels are modeled on HTML. However, there are many aspects that are relevant to Graphviz labels that are not in HTML and, conversely, HTML allows various constructs which are meaningless in Graphviz. We will generally refer to these labels as \"HTML labels\" rather than the cumbersome \"HTML-like labels\" but the reader is warned that these are not really HTML. The grammar below describes precisely what Graphviz will accept.\nAlthough HTML labels are not, strictly speaking, a shape, they can be viewed as a generalization of the record shapes described above. In particular, if a node has set its shape attribute to none or plaintext, the HTML label will be the node's shape. On the other hand, if the node has any other shape (except point), the HTML label will be embedded within the node the same way an ordinary label would be. Adding HTML labels to record-based shapes (record and Mrecord) is discouraged and may lead to unexpected behavior because of their conflicting label schemas and overlapping functionality.\nThe following is an abstract grammar for HTML labels. Terminals, corresponding to elements, are shown in bold font, and nonterminals in italics. Square brackets [ and ] enclose optional items. Vertical bars | separate alternatives. Note that, as in HTML, element and attribute names are case-insensitive. (cf. sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of the HTML 4.01 specification).\nlabel : text | fonttable text : textitem | text textitem textitem : string | \u003cBR/\u003e | \u003cFONT\u003e text \u003c/FONT\u003e | \u003cI\u003e text \u003c/I\u003e | \u003cB\u003e text \u003c/B\u003e | \u003cU\u003e text \u003c/U\u003e | \u003cO\u003e text \u003c/O\u003e | \u003cSUB\u003e text \u003c/SUB\u003e | \u003cSUP\u003e text \u003c/SUP\u003e | \u003cS\u003e text \u003c/S\u003e fonttable : table | \u003cFONT\u003e table \u003c/FONT\u003e | \u003cI\u003e table \u003c/I\u003e | \u003cB\u003e table \u003c/B\u003e | \u003cU\u003e table \u003c/U\u003e | \u003cO\u003e table \u003c/O\u003e table : \u003cTABLE\u003e rows \u003c/TABLE\u003e rows : row | rows row | rows \u003cHR/\u003e row row : \u003cTR\u003e cells \u003c/TR\u003e cells : cell | cells cell | cells \u003cVR/\u003e cell cell : \u003cTD\u003e label \u003c/TD\u003e | \u003cTD\u003e \u003cIMG/\u003e \u003c/TD\u003e All non-printing characters such as tabs or newlines are ignored. Above, a string is any collection of printable characters, including spaces. For tables, outside of the body of a \u003cTD\u003e element, whitespace characters are ignored, including spaces; within a \u003cTD\u003e element, spaces are preserved but all other white space characters are discarded. N.B. For technical reasons, if a table is wrapped in a font element such as \u003cFONT\u003e or \u003cB\u003e, any space immediately before or after this will cause a syntax error. For example, the label\n\u003c \u003cU\u003e\u003cTABLE\u003e\u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD\u003ea\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e\u003c/U\u003e\u003e is not legal. Removing either the space or the \u003cU\u003e...\u003c/U\u003e will fix this.\nHTML comments are allowed within an HTML string. They can occur anywhere provided that, if they contain part of an HTML element, they must contain the entire element.\nAs is obvious from the above description, the interpretation of white space characters is one place where HTML-like labels is very different from standard HTML. In HTML, any sequence of white space characters is collapsed to a single space, If the user does not want this to happen, the input must use non-breaking spaces \u0026nbsp;. This makes sense in HTML, where text layout depends dynamically on the space available. In Graphviz, the layout is statically determined by the input, so it is reasonable to treat ordinary space characters as non-breaking. In addition, ignoring tabs and newlines allows the input text to be formatted for easier reading.\nEach of the HTML elements has a set of optional attributes. Attribute values must appear in double quotes.\nTable element \u003cTABLE ALIGN=\"CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT\" BGCOLOR=color\" BORDER=\"value\" CELLBORDER=\"value\" CELLPADDING=\"value\" CELLSPACING=\"value\" COLOR=\"color\" COLUMNS=\"value\" FIXEDSIZE=\"FALSE|TRUE\" GRADIENTANGLE=\"value\" HEIGHT=\"value\" HREF=\"value\" ID=\"value\" PORT=\"portName\" ROWS=\"value\" SIDES=\"value\" STYLE=\"value\" TARGET=\"value\" TITLE=\"value\" TOOLTIP=\"value\" VALIGN=\"MIDDLE|BOTTOM|TOP\" WIDTH=\"value\" \u003e Table row \u003cTR \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Table cell \u003cTD ALIGN=\"CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT|TEXT\" BALIGN=\"CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT\" BGCOLOR=\"color\" BORDER=\"value\" CELLPADDING=\"value\" CELLSPACING=\"value\" COLOR=\"color\" COLSPAN=\"value\" FIXEDSIZE=\"FALSE|TRUE\" GRADIENTANGLE=\"value\" HEIGHT=\"value\" HREF=\"value\" ID=\"value\" PORT=\"portName\" ROWSPAN=\"value\" SIDES=\"value\" STYLE=\"value\" TARGET=\"value\" TITLE=\"value\" TOOLTIP=\"value\" VALIGN=\"MIDDLE|BOTTOM|TOP\" WIDTH=\"value\" \u003e Font specification \u003cFONT COLOR=\"color\" FACE=\"fontname\" POINT-SIZE=\"value\" \u003e Line break \u003cBR ALIGN=\"CENTER|LEFT|RIGHT\" /\u003e Image inclusion \u003cIMG SCALE=\"FALSE|TRUE|WIDTH|HEIGHT|BOTH\" SRC=\"value\" /\u003e Italic style \u003cI \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Bold style \u003cB \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Underline text \u003cU \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Overline text \u003cO \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Subscript text \u003cSUB \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Superscript text \u003cSUP \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Strike-through text \u003cS \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e \u003e Horizontal rule \u003cHR \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e /\u003e Vertical rule \u003cVR \u003c!-- No attributes --\u003e /\u003e ALIGN specifies horizontal placement. When an object is allocated more space than required, this value determines where the extra space is placed left and right of the object. CENTER aligns the object in the center. (Default) LEFT aligns the object on the left. RIGHT aligns the object on the right. (\u003cTD\u003e only) TEXT aligns lines of text using the full cell width. The alignment of a line is determined by its (possibly implicit) associated \u003cBR\u003e element. The contents of a cell are normally aligned as a block. In particular, lines of text are first aligned as a text block based on the width of the widest line and the corresponding \u003cBR\u003e elements. Then, the entire text block is aligned within a cell. If, however, the cell's ALIGN value is TEXT, and the cell contains lines of text, then the lines are justified using the entire available width of the cell. If the cell does not contain text, then the contained image or table is centered.\nBALIGN specifies the default alignment of \u003cBR\u003e elements contained in the cell. That is, if a \u003cBR\u003e element has no explicit ALIGN attribute, the attribute value is specified by the value of BALIGN. BGCOLOR=\"color\" sets the color of the background. This color can be overridden by a BGCOLOR attribute in descendents. The value can be a single color or two colors separated by a colon, the latter indicating a gradient fill. BORDER=\"value\" specifies the width of the border around the object in points. A value of zero indicates no border. The default is 1. The maximum value is 255. If set in a table, and CELLBORDER is not set, this value is also used for all cells in the table. It can be overridden by a BORDER attribute in a cell. CELLBORDER=\"value\" specifies the width of the border for all cells in a table. It can be overridden by a BORDER tag in a cell. The maximum value is 127. CELLPADDING=\"value\" specifies the space, in points, between a cell's border and its content. The default is 2. The maximum value is 255. CELLSPACING=\"value\" specifies the space, in points, between cells in a table and between a cell and the table's border. The default is 2. The maximum value is 127. COLOR=\"color\" sets the color of the font within the scope of \u003cFONT\u003e...\u003c/FONT\u003e, or the border color of the table or cell within the scope of \u003cTABLE\u003e...\u003c/TABLE\u003e, or \u003cTD\u003e...\u003c/TD\u003e. This color can be overridden by a COLOR attribute in descendents. By default, the font color is determined by the fontcolor attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph, and the border color is determined by the color attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph. COLSPAN=\"value\" specifies the number of columns spanned by the cell. The default is 1. The maximum value is 65535. COLUMNS=\"value\" provides general formatting information concerning the columns. At present, the only legal value is *, which causes a vertical rule to appear between every cell in every row. FACE=\"fontname\" specifies the font to use within the scope of \u003cFONT\u003e...\u003c/FONT\u003e. This can be overridden by a FACE attribute in descendents. By default, the font name is determined by the fontname attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph. FIXEDSIZE specifies whether the values given by the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes are enforced. FALSE allows the object to grow so that all its contents will fit. (Default) TRUE fixes the object size to its given WIDTH and HEIGHT. Both of these attributes must be supplied. GRADIENTANGLE=\"value\" gives the angle used in a gradient fill if the BGCOLOR is a color list. For the default linear gradient, this specifies the angle of a line through the center along which the colors transform. Thus, an angle of 0 will cause a left-to-right progression. For radial gradients (see STYLE), the angle specifies the position of the center of the coloring. An angle of 0 places the center at the center of the table or cell; an non-zero angle places the fill center along that angle near the boundary. HEIGHT=\"value\" specifies the mininum height, in points, of the object. The height includes the contents, any spacing and the border. Unless FIXEDSIZE is true, the height will be expanded to allow the contents to fit. The maximum value is 65535. HREF=\"value\" attaches a URL to the object. Note that the \"value\" is treated as an escString similarly to the URL attribute. ID=\"value\" allows the user to specify a unique ID for a table or cell. See the id attribute for more information. Note that the \"value\" is treated as an escString similarly to the id attribute. POINT-SIZE=\"value\" sets the size of the font, in points, used within the scope of \u003cFONT\u003e...\u003c/FONT\u003e. This can be overridden by a POINT-SIZE attribute in descendents. By default, the font size is determined by the fontsize attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph. PORT=\"value\" attaches a portname to the object. (See portPos.) This can be used to modify the head or tail of an edge, so that the end attaches directly to the object. ROWS=\"value\" provides general formatting information concerning the rows. At present, the only legal value is *, which causes a horizontal rule to appear between every row. ROWSPAN=\"value\" specifies the number of rows spanned by the cell. The default is 1. The maximum value is 65535. SCALE specifies how an image will use any extra space available in its cell. Allowed values are FALSE : keep image its natural size. (Default) TRUE : scale image uniformly to fit. WIDTH : expand image width to fill HEIGHT : expand image height to fill BOTH : expand both image width height to fill If this attribute is undefined, the image inherits the imagescale attribute of the graph object being drawn. As with the imagescale attribute, if the cell has a fixed size and the image is too large, any offending dimension will be shrunk to fit the space, the scaling being uniform in width and height if SCALE=\"true\". Note that the containing cell's ALIGN and VALIGN attributes override an image's SCALE attribute. SIDES=\"value\" specifies which sides of a border in a cell or table should be drawn, if a border is drawn. By default, all sides are drawn. The \"value\" string can contain any collection of the (case-insensitive) characters 'L', 'T', 'R', or 'B', corresponding to the left, top, right and, bottom sides of the border, respectively. For example, SIDES=\"LB\" would indicate only the left and bottom segments of the border should be drawn. SRC=\"value\" specifies the image file to be displayed in the cell. Note that if the software is used as a web server, file system access to images is more restricted. See SERVER_NAME. STYLE specifies style characteristics of the table or cell. Style characteristics are given as a comma or space separated list of style attributes. At present, the only legal attributes are ROUNDED and RADIAL for tables, and RADIAL for cells. If ROUNDED is specified, the table will have rounded corners. This probably works best if the outmost cells have no borders, or their CELLSPACING is sufficiently large. If it is desirable to have borders around the cells, use HR and VR elements, or the COLUMNS and ROWS attributes of TABLE. The RADIAL attribute indicates a radial gradient fill. See the BGCOLOR and GRADIENTANGLE attributes.\nTARGET=\"value\" determines which window of the browser is used for the URL if the object has one. See W3C documentation. Note that the \"value\" is treated as an escString similarly to the target attribute. TITLE=\"value\" sets the tooltip annotation attached to the element. This is used only if the element has a HREF attribute. Note that the \"value\" is treated as an escString similarly to the tooltip attribute. TOOLTIP=\"value\" is an alias for TITLE. VALIGN specifies vertical placement. When an object is allocated more space than required, this value determines where the extra space is placed above and below the object. MIDDLE aligns the object in the center. (Default) BOTTOM aligns the object on the bottom. TOP aligns the object on the top. WIDTH=\"value\" specifies the mininum width, in points, of the object. The width includes the contents, any spacing and the border. Unless FIXEDSIZE is true, the width will be expanded to allow the contents to fit. The maximum value is 65535. There is some inheritance among the attributes. If a table specifies a CELLPADDING, CELLBORDER or BORDER value, this value is used by the table's cells unless overridden. If a cell or table specifies a BGCOLOR, this will be the background color for all of its descendents. Of course, if a background or fill color is specified for the graph object owning the label, this will be the original background for the label. The object's fontname, fontcolor and fontsize attributes are the default for drawing text. These can be overridden by using FONT to set new values. The new font values will hold until overridden by an enclosed FONT element. Finally, the pencolor or color of the graph object will be used as the border color.\nIf you want horizontal or vertical rules used uniformly within a table, consider using the COLUMNS or ROWS attributes rather than using many HR and VR elements.\nBecause of certain limitations in handling tables in a device-independent manner, when BORDER is 1 and both table and cell borders are on and CELLSPACING is less than 2, anomalies can arise in the output, such as gaps between sides of borders which should be abutting or even collinear. The user can usual get around this by increasing the border size or the spacing, or turning off the table border.\nHTML-Like Label Examples Recreating the Record Example The dot input:\ndigraph structs { node [shape=plaintext] struct1 [label=\u003c \u003cTABLE BORDER=\"0\" CELLBORDER=\"1\" CELLSPACING=\"0\"\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD\u003eleft\u003c/TD\u003e\u003cTD PORT=\"f1\"\u003emid dle\u003c/TD\u003e\u003cTD PORT=\"f2\"\u003eright\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e]; struct2 [label=\u003c \u003cTABLE BORDER=\"0\" CELLBORDER=\"1\" CELLSPACING=\"0\"\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD PORT=\"f0\"\u003eone\u003c/TD\u003e\u003cTD\u003etwo\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e]; struct3 [label=\u003c \u003cTABLE BORDER=\"0\" CELLBORDER=\"1\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"4\"\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD ROWSPAN=\"3\"\u003ehello\u003cBR/\u003eworld\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD COLSPAN=\"3\"\u003eb\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD ROWSPAN=\"3\"\u003eg\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD ROWSPAN=\"3\"\u003eh\u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD\u003ec\u003c/TD\u003e\u003cTD PORT=\"here\"\u003ed\u003c/TD\u003e\u003cTD\u003ee\u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD COLSPAN=\"3\"\u003ef\u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e]; struct1:f1 -\u003e struct2:f0; struct1:f2 -\u003e struct3:here; } Edit in Playground produces the HTML analogue of the record example above:\nAs usual, an HTML specification is more verbose.\nMore Complex Example On the other hand, HTML labels are much more general:\ndigraph G { rankdir=LR node [shape=plaintext] a [ label=\u003c \u003cTABLE BORDER=\"0\" CELLBORDER=\"1\" CELLSPACING=\"0\"\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD ROWSPAN=\"3\" BGCOLOR=\"yellow\"\u003eclass\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD PORT=\"here\" BGCOLOR=\"lightblue\"\u003equalifier\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e ] b [shape=ellipse style=filled label=\u003c \u003cTABLE BGCOLOR=\"bisque\"\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD COLSPAN=\"3\"\u003eelephant\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD ROWSPAN=\"2\" BGCOLOR=\"chartreuse\" VALIGN=\"bottom\" ALIGN=\"right\"\u003etwo\u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD COLSPAN=\"2\" ROWSPAN=\"2\"\u003e \u003cTABLE BGCOLOR=\"grey\"\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD\u003ecorn\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD BGCOLOR=\"yellow\"\u003ec\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD\u003ef\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e \u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD BGCOLOR=\"white\"\u003epenguin\u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD COLSPAN=\"2\" BORDER=\"4\" ALIGN=\"right\" PORT=\"there\"\u003e4\u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e ] c [ label=\u003clong line 1\u003cBR/\u003eline 2\u003cBR ALIGN=\"LEFT\"/\u003eline 3\u003cBR ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"/\u003e\u003e ] subgraph { rank=same b c } a:here -\u003e b:there [dir=both arrowtail=diamond] c -\u003e b d [shape=triangle] d -\u003e c [label=\u003c \u003cTABLE\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD BGCOLOR=\"red\" WIDTH=\"10\"\u003e \u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD\u003eEdge labels\u003cBR/\u003ealso\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD BGCOLOR=\"blue\" WIDTH=\"10\"\u003e \u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e ] } Edit in Playground produces:\nFonts Example An example using \u003cFONT\u003e elements:\ndigraph structs { node [shape=plaintext]; struct1 [label=\u003c\u003cTABLE\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD\u003eline 1\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD BGCOLOR=\"blue\"\u003e\u003cFONT COLOR=\"white\"\u003eline2\u003c/FONT\u003e\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD BGCOLOR=\"gray\"\u003e\u003cFONT POINT-SIZE=\"24.0\"\u003eline3\u003c/FONT\u003e\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD BGCOLOR=\"yellow\"\u003e\u003cFONT POINT-SIZE=\"24.0\" FACE=\"ambrosia\"\u003eline4\u003c/FONT\u003e\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD\u003e \u003cTABLE CELLPADDING=\"0\" BORDER=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\"\u003e \u003cTR\u003e \u003cTD\u003e\u003cFONT COLOR=\"green\"\u003eMixed\u003c/FONT\u003e\u003c/TD\u003e \u003cTD\u003e\u003cFONT COLOR=\"red\"\u003efonts\u003c/FONT\u003e\u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e \u003c/TD\u003e \u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e]; } Edit in Playground produces:\nImages Example Using an \u003cIMG\u003e element:\ndigraph structs { node [shape=plaintext]; struct1 [label=\u003c\u003cTABLE\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD\u003e\u003cIMG SRC=\"eqn.png\"/\u003e\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003cTR\u003e\u003cTD\u003ecaption\u003c/TD\u003e\u003c/TR\u003e \u003c/TABLE\u003e\u003e]; } Edit in Playground produces:\nSides Example The sides attribute (version 2.37 and later) allows one to combine cells to form various non-convex shapes.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS \"Contribution\" means:\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\ni) changes to the Program, and\nii) additions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. \"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n3. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\nb) its license agreement:\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form:\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

Terminals are shown in bold font and nonterminals in italics. Literal characters are given in single quotes. Square brackets [ and ] enclose optional items. Vertical bars | separate alternatives.\nGrammar arrowname : aname [ aname [ aname [ aname ] ] ] aname : [ modifiers ] shape modifiers : [ 'o' ] [ side ] side : 'l' | 'r' shape : box | crow | curve | icurve | diamond | dot | inv | none | normal | tee | vee Primitive Shapes Shape Image box crow curve diamond dot icurve inv none normal tee vee Shape Modifiers As for the modifiers:\n'l' Clip the shape, leaving only the part to the left of the edge. 'r' Clip the shape, leaving only the part to the right of the edge. 'o' Use an open (non-filled) version of the shape. Left and right are defined as those directions determined by looking from the edge towards the point where the arrow \"touches\" the node.\nAs an example, the arrow shape lteeoldiamond is parsed as 'l' 'tee' 'o' 'l' 'diamond' and corresponds to the shape:\nNote that the first arrow shape specified occurs closest to the node. Subsequent arrow shapes, if specified, occur further from the node. Also, a shape of none uses space, so, for example, the arrowhead nonenormal is not the same as normal.\nNot all syntactically legal combinations of modifiers are meaningful or semantically valid. For example, none of the modifiers make any sense with none. The following table indicates which modifiers are allowed with which shapes.\nModifier 'l'/'r' o box ✅ ✅ crow ✅ curve ✅ diamond ✅ ✅ dot ✅ icurve ✅ inv ✅ ✅ none normal ✅ ✅ tee ✅ vee ✅ This yields 42 different arrow shapes. The optional second, third, fourth shapes can independently be any of the 42, except the last cannot be none as this would create a redundant shape. Thus, there are 41 × 42³ + 41 × 42² + 41 × 42 + 42 = 3,111,696 different combinations.\nThe following display contains the 42 combinations possible with a single arrow shape. The node attached to the arrow is not drawn but would appear on the right side of the edge.\nbox lbox rbox obox olbox orbox crow lcrow rcrow diamond ldiamond rdiamond odiamond oldiamond ordiamond dot odot inv linv rinv oinv olinv orinv none normal lnormal rnormal onormal olnormal ornormal tee ltee rtee vee lvee rvee curve lcurve rcurve icurve licurve ricurve ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Arrow shapes can be specified and named using the following simple …","ref":"/doc/info/arrows.html","tags":"","title":"Arrow Shapes"},{"body":"Color names are resolved in the context of a color scheme.

See Graph Attributes. There is also information on command-line usage and output formats.\nWhere can I discuss Graphviz? Post questions and comments in the Graphviz forum\nI'm trying to make a layout larger. How? There are various ways to increase the size of a layout. In doing this, one has to decide if the sizes of the nodes and text should be increased as well.\nOne approach is to adjust individual parameters such as fontsize, nodesep and ranksep. For example,\ndigraph G { graph [fontsize=24] edge [fontsize=24] node [fontsize=24] ranksep = 1.5 nodesep = .25 edge [style=\"setlinewidth(3)\"] a -\u003e b -\u003e c } Edit in Playground If you do this, make sure you are not fighting a conflicting graph size setting, like size=\"6,6\", which will then scale everything back down.\nIf you are using fdp or neato, increasing the edge len will tend to expand the layout.\ngraph G { layout=\"neato\" edge [len=3] a -- { b c d } } Edit in Playground For twopi and circo, there are other parameters such as ranksep which can be used. See the graph attributes.\nYou can also use the ratio attribute. If you set the size attribute to the desired drawing size, and then set ratio=fill, node positions are scaled separately in x and y until the drawing fills the specified size. Note that node sizes stay the same. If, instead, you set ratio=expand, the layout is uniformly scaled up in x and y until at least one dimension fits size.\nIf you specify the size attribute but end it with an exclamation mark (!), the final drawing will be scaled up uniformly in x and y until at least one dimension fits size. Note that everything is scaled up, including text and node sizes.\nIf you're using PostScript, you can just scale up the output by manually adding a command such as 2 2 scale where the PostScript environment is set up. Make sure to adjust the BoundingBox too if your tools look at this header.\nHow can I join or merge certain edge routes in dot? You can try running dot -Gconcentrate=true or you can introduce your own virtual nodes drawn as tiny circles where you want to split or join edges:\ndigraph G { yourvirtualnode [shape=circle,width=.01,height=.01,label=\"\"] a -\u003e yourvirtualnode [arrowhead=none] yourvirtualnode -\u003e {b;c} } Edit in Playground How can I generate graph layouts in PDF? If your version of Graphviz has cairo/pango support, you can just use the -Tpdf flag. Unfortunately, this does not handle embedded links.\nIf you need embedded links, or don't have cairo/pango, create PostScript output, then use an external converter from PostScript to PDF. For example, dot -Tps | epsf2pdf -o file.pdf. Note that URL tags are respected, to allow clickable PDF objects.\nIf your intention is to use the figure as PDF in some document preparation system, such as pdflatex, it is very important to use -Tps2 rather than -Tps. In general, if you really want PDF output, that is, you would like to have a -Tpdf flag, use -Tps2 before converting to PDF.\nIn the diagram below, the shaded nodes will contain bad output.\nHow can I make duplicate nodes? Make unique nodes with duplicate labels.\ndigraph G { node001 [label = \"A\"] node002 [label = \"A\"] node001 -\u003e node002 } Edit in Playground How can I set a graph or cluster label without its propagating to all sub-clusters? Set the label at the end of the graph (before the closing brace), after all its contents have been defined. (We admit it seems desirable to define some special syntax for non-inherited attribute settings.)\nHow can I draw multiple parallel edges in neato? When the splines attribute is false, which is the default, multiedges are drawn as a spindle of simply curved edges. There is no attempt to avoid intervening nodes.\nWhen splines=true or polyline, multiedges are drawn as roughly parallel splines or polylines. This relies on there being no node overlaps.\nAn additional trick which is sometimes sufficient is to specify multiple colors for the edge using a color list. This will a produce set of tightly parallel splines, each in its specified color. Read about the color attribute for more information.\nHow can I symmetrize (balance) tree layouts? When a tree node has an even number of children, it isn't necessarily centered above the two middle ones. If you know the order of the children, a simple hack is to introduce new, invisible middle nodes to re-balance the layout. The connecting edges should also be invisible. For example:\ndigraph G { a -\u003e b0 xb [label=\"\",width=.1,style=invis] a -\u003e xb [style=invis] a -\u003e b1 {rank=same b0 -\u003e xb -\u003e b1 [style=invis]} b0 -\u003e c0 xc [label=\"\",width=.1,style=invis] b0 -\u003e xc [style=invis] b0 -\u003e c1 {rank=same c0 -\u003e xc -\u003e c1 [style=invis]} } Edit in Playground This trick really ought to be built into our solver (and made independent of the order of the children, and available for layouts other than trees, too).\nHow can I report a bug or issue I've found? You can report or view Graphviz bugs and issues by visiting the Graphviz Issues page.\nClusters How can I create edges between cluster boxes? This only works in Graphviz version 1.7 and higher. To make edges between clusters, first set the graph attribute compound=true. Then, you can specify a cluster by name as a logical head or tail to an edge. This will cause the edge joining the two nodes to be clipped to the exterior of the box around the given cluster.\nFor example,\ndigraph G { compound=true; nodesep=1.0; subgraph cluster_A { a -\u003e b; a -\u003e c; } subgraph cluster_B { d -\u003e e; f -\u003e e; } a -\u003e e [ ltail=cluster_A, lhead=cluster_B ]; } Edit in Playground has an edge going from cluster_A to cluster_B. If, instead, you say\na -\u003e e [ltail=cluster_A]; this gives you an edge from cluster_A to node e. Or you could just specify an lhead attribute. The program warns if a cluster specified as a logical node is not defined. Also, if a cluster is specified as a logical head for an edge, the real head must be contained in the cluster, and the real tail must not be. A similar check is done for logical tails. In these cases, the edge is drawn between the real nodes as usual.\nClusters are hard to see. Set bgcolor=grey (or some other color) in the cluster.\nOutput How can I get high quality (antialiased) output? The easiest thing is to use a vector-based output formats such as PDF, SVG or PostScript. In addition, if Graphviz has a cairo/pango backend, this will generate anti-aliased output.\nAnother approach is to make the layout in PostScript (option -Tps), then run through Ghostview with antialiasing enabled. The important command line options are:\n-dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 (4 is the highest level of antialiasing allowed - see the Ghostview documentation). The full command line to render a raster could be something like:\n$ gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 -sDEVICE=png16m -sOutputFile=file.png file.ps On Mac OS X, the pixelglow port uses Apple's Quartz renderer, which enables antialiasing. It also provides a beautiful document container for its user interface. (One downside is that you can't run Pixelglow Graphviz as a web server or other background process if your Mac has 3D graphics, because Quartz wants to get this resource to accelerate rendering.)\nI can only get 11x17 output? It's not us! It's probably your printer setup. If you don't believe this, run dot -Tps and look at the BoundingBox header. The coords are in 1/72ths of an inch.\nHow do I create special symbols and accents in labels? Insert the symbol directly (such as with copy/paste) into your dot source, and save as UTF-8, e.g.:\ngraph G { yen [label=\"¥\"] } Edit in Playground If you can't save in UTF-8, try HTML entities, e.g. \u0026#165; for the Yen currency symbol ¥. Example:\ngraph G { yen [label=\"\u0026#165;\"] } Edit in Playground More generally, how do I use non-ASCII character sets? The following applies to Graphviz 2.8 and later. (In older versions of Graphviz, you can sometimes get away with simply putting Latin-1 or other UTF-8 characters in the input stream, but the results are not always correct.)\nInput: the general idea is to find the Unicode value for the glyph you want, and enter it within a text string \"...\" or HTML-like label \u003c...\u003e.\nFor example, the mathematical forall sign ∀ has the value 0x2200. There are several ways this can be inserted into a file. One is to write out the ASCII representation: \u0026#\u003cnnn\u003e; where \u003cnnn\u003e is the decimal representation of the value. The decimal value of 0x2200 is 8704, so the character can be specified as \u0026#8704; . Alternatively, Graphviz accepts UTF-8 encoded input. In the case of forall, its UTF-8 representation is 3 bytes whose decimal values are 226 136 128. For convenience, you would probably enter this using your favorite editor, tuned to your character set of choice. You can then use the iconv program to map the graph from your character set to UTF-8 or Latin-1.\nWe also accept the HTML symbolic names for Latin-1 characters as suggested in FaqSymbols. For example, the cent sign (unicode and Latin-1 value decimal 162) can be inserted as \u0026cent;\nNote that the graph file must always be a plain text document not a Word or other rich format file. Any characters not enclosed in \"...\" or \u003c...\u003e must be ordinary ASCII characters. In particular, all of the DOT keywords such as digraph or subgraph must be ASCII.\nBecause we cannot always guess the encoding, you should set the graph attribute charset to UTF-8, Latin1 (alias ISO-8859-1 or ISO-IR-100) or Big-5 for Traditional Chinese. This can be done in the graph file or on the command line. For example charset=Latin1.\nOutput: It is essential that a font which has the glyphs for your specified characters is available at final rendering time. The choice of this font depends on the target code generator. For the gd-based raster generators (PNG, GIF, etc.) you need a TrueType or Type-1 font file on the machine running the Graphviz program. If Graphviz is built with the fontconfig library, it will be used to find the specified font. Otherwise, Graphviz will look in various default directories for the font. The directories to be searched include those specified by the fontpath attribute, related environment or shell variables (see the fontpath entry), and known system font directories. The table points out that these glyphs are from the times.ttf font. With fontconfig, it's hard to specify this font. Times usually gets resolved to Adobe Type1 times, which doesn't have all the glyphs seen on that page.)\nFor PostScript, the input must be either the ASCII subset of UTF-8 or Latin-1. (We have looked for more general solutions, but it appears that UTF-8 and Unicode are handled differently for every kind of font type in PostScript, and we don't have time to hack this case-by-case.\nFor SVG output, we just pass the raw UTF-8 (or other encoding) straight through to the generated code.\nHow can I create custom shapes? One approach is to use HTML-like labels possibly combined with embedded images use the IMG attribute.\nAs alluded to in the dot user's guide, if you want truly custom shape, there are several ways to incorporate this. At this point, they either must be in PostScript or image files, or you'll need to modify the source code. A serious problem is that you can't make custom shapes that work across all the drivers and the interactive front-ends such as Grappa. At least SVG has interactive renderers, and PostScript can be translated to PDF which also has some interactive features.\nExternal image files\nIf using SVG (-Tsvg), PostScript (-Tps,-Tps2) or one of the raster formats (-Tgif, -Tpng, or -Tjpg), you can load certain images (e.g., pictures) by file name into nodes. For example:\nyournode [image=\"yourface.gif\"]; indicates the contents of the node are given in the GIF file yourface.gif. The image attribute specifies which file to use. (There is also the deprecated shapefile attribute. This is similar to image but the node shape will always be a box.)\nNOTE: In versions before 11 March 2006, in particular, 1.12 graphviz and earlier, it is necessary to also set the attribute shape=custom.\nWith -Tsvg, image must give the name of a file containing a GIF, PNG or JPEG bitmap file. Note that the file's contents are not copied into the SVG output, only the files name. Thus, for Graphviz SVG output to display correctly, the image file must be available to the SVG viewer.\nWith PostScript, image must give the name of a file containing encapsulated PostScript or a bitmap. The contents are copied into the output file. Note that encapsulated PostScript will only be copied in once. The restrictions on the contents of the image are the same as those specified below under External PostScript files.\nFor bitmap output, image is a file name containing a bitmap image. The file is opened and copied (and possibly scaled) into the output drawing.\nThis code is still preliminary, and we have noted some problems with color quantization in indexed color map management that we are trying to understand and correct. (You can use -Gtruecolor=1 to try a 32 bit internal canvas as an alternative, but we have observed fuzziness (lossiness?) in the images.)\nWhen the software is used as a web server, access to image files is more restrictive. See SERVER_NAME.\nExternal PostScript files\nIf using the PostScript driver (-Tps) you can import node shapes as external PostScript files such as EPS (Encapsulated PostScript). At a minimum, the external file must have a valid BoundingBox header and not do drastic things to the graphics state since we don't install a wrapper for example to inhibit showpage.\nTo import an external PostScript file, set the shape and shapefile attributes as shown here:\nsomenode [shape=epsf, shapefile=\"yourfile.ps\" ]; An EPSF shape is always clipped to its bounding box.\nThe use of [shape=epsf, shapefile=\"yourfile.ps\" ] is largely superseded by the mechanism described in the previous section, using [image=\"yourfile.ps\" ].\nExternal PostScript procedures\nIf using the PostScript driver (dot -Tps), you can define a PostScript procedure for shape drawing. The procedure must be able to draw variable-sized shapes. A file containing the definition can be loaded as a command line argument using the -l flag:\n$ dot -Tps -l yourPS.ps file.dot -o file.ps In the graph file, invoke the shape like this:\nsomenode [shape=yourshape] In file.ps, for non-filled nodes, the procedure for yourshape will be called like this:\n[ 54 36 0 36 0 0 54 0 54 36 ] 4 false yourshape where the current color is the node's pencolor. The array contains the shape's bounding polygon, with the first point repeated at the end, followed by the number of points. At present, the shape is always a rectangle. From left to right, the points in the array always go counterclockwise, starting with the upper-right vertex. The boolean value after the number of vertices, here false, is the value of the node's fill attribute. The coordinates are absolute canvas coordinates.\nFor nodes with fill=true, the above invocation of yourshape will be preceded by\n[ 54 36 0 36 0 0 54 0 54 36 ] 4 true yourshape where the current color is the node's fillcolor.\nNOTE: In versions before 23 September 2005, yourshape is only invoked once, with the node's fill value and with the color set to the node's pencolor.\nFor example, here are the contents of a plausible shape file, DFD.ps, which can be invoked by [shape=DFDbox]\n/xdef {exch def} bind def /DFDbox { 10 dict begin /fflag xdef /sides xdef fflag % if shape is filled { aload pop newpath moveto 1 1 sides { pop lineto } for closepath fill } { aload pop % draw the sides newpath moveto 1 1 sides { 2 mod 0 ne {moveto} % even sides {lineto currentpoint stroke moveto} % odd sides ifelse } for } ifelse end } bind def A custom shape of this kind is always clipped to its bounding box. It would not be hard to create a hook in the function user_shape() in shapes.c to determine clipping polygons other than rectangles (maybe) in case someone wants to try this and contribute the code for this.\nNote that, by default, the bounding box is drawn around the contents and the node label is drawn. If you wish to eliminate these, set label=\"\" and peripheries=0 in the node.\nDriver-independent custom shapes\nIf not using PostScript, you'll need to roll up your sleeves and modify the source. None of the other code generators support custom node shapes directly. If the custom shape is to be high-level and driver-independent, then you can add shape-specific functions (methods) to shapes.c with a corresponding entry in the array Shapes[] that maps shape names to methods. The method interfaces are described in the comment header in this file. Methods must be defined to initialize a shape (typically to size it big enough to fit its text label), bind a port name to a coordinate, test if a point is inside an instance of the shape (for edge clipping), generate code for the shape via the functions provided in the gvrender_engine_t structure, and return a box path to reach ports on the interior of a node (if they can exist).\nMore information on the functions available via gvrender_engine_t and the Graphviz graphics model can be found in Section 5 of the Graphviz library manual.\nShapes that behave more or less like polygons can be bootstrapped from the basic polygon methods; see for example the invtri or tab shape. Such shapes use a polygon descriptor whose fields are listed below.\nField name Description Default regular if a regular polygon FALSE peripheries number of border peripheries 1 sides number of sides (1 for curves) 4 orientation angular rotation in degrees 0 distortion trapezoidal distortion 0 skew parallelogram distortion 0 option fancy options: ROUNDED, DIAGONALS, AUXLABELS 0 For shapes not derived from general polygons, see the record or epsf shape.\nDriver-dependent custom shapes\nTo implement a driver-specific shape (such as GIF or PNG icons) you'll need to write a body for the driver function that implements user-defined shapes. This involves providing the library_shape function for the specific driver, if it does not already exist, and generating the graphics operations needed to display your shape using the driver's graphics functions. (The drivers supplied with Graphviz can be found in the plugins directory.)\nA user shape function basically receives four arguments:\nthe custom shape name string the absolute canvas coords of the shape bounding polygon number of coords (currently, always 4) fill flag The rest is up to you, but contact us first just in case.\nHow can I use drawing layers (overlays)? If the layers graph attribute is set, the graph is printed in a sequence of colored layers, or overlays. (This coloring overrides any other settings.) layers defines a list of layer names, each separated by a sequence of separator characters. The tokens can be any identifier or natural number, except the reserved word all. By default, the separator characters are colon, space and tab, though this can be overridden using the layersep graph attribute.\nThe layer attribute of a node, edge or cluster enables its appearance in given layers. Its value denotes a list of layers from the layers graph attribute. It is specified by a list of layer intervals, separated by a sequence of characters from the layerlistsep attribute. Each layer interval is written as a single layer name or two layer names separated by a sequence of separator characters from the layersep attribute. The keyword all means all possible layers. If all is used as part of a range, the range denotes all layers bounded on one side by the other token. Thus, the layer pvt:all of the edge node2 -\u003e node3 in the example below corresponds to the layers pvt, test, new, and ofc. The all:pvt,new,ofc corresponds to the layers local, pvt, new, and ofc.\nAs an example, the graph:\ndigraph G { layers=\"local:pvt:test:new:ofc\"; node1 [layer=\"pvt\"]; node2 [layer=\"all\"]; node3 [layer=\"pvt:ofc\"];\t/* pvt, test, new, and ofc */ node2 -\u003e node3 [layer=\"pvt:all\"];\t/* same as pvt:ofc */ node2 -\u003e node4 [layer=3];\t/* same as test */ } Edit in Playground produces the 5 layers shown below:\nLayer 1 Layer 2 Layer 3 Layer 4 Layer 5 In a layered graph, if a given node (or edge) does not have a layer assignment, but incident edges (nodes, resp.) do, its layer specification is inferred from these. For example, in the examples above, node4 only appears on layer 3, because a layer assignment was given for its connecting edge. Note, however, that if a node or edge without a layer attribute is incident with an edge or node without a layer attribute (or such a node has no edges), then the node or edge appears on all layers.\nTo change the default so that nodes and edges with no layer attribute appear on all layers, insert\nnode [layer=all]; edge [layer=all]; at the beginning of the graph file.\nThe graph can have a layerselect attribute, which specifies which layers should be emitted. The value uses the same concrete syntax as the layer attribute.\nAt present, the output of multiple layers into a single output file is only available in PostScript. However, the layerselect attribute can be used to select a single layer for output in any format.\nThe color sequence for layers is set in the array layercolorseq (in PostScript at least). The first index is 1 and each element is a three-element color coordinate array. Custom layer colors can be created by setting the value of this array.\nTODO\nsimply change default colors per layer, thus allowing user override on individual nodes or edges when desired. turn off layer coloring entirely and just use the colors inherent in the drawing. forcing nodes/edges in a given subgraph to take certain attributes. Might require a hook in the libgraph parser. It would be pretty easy to support the semantics: for every node/edge in this subgraph, assign it the default attributes that differ from the defaults of the parent of this graph. What you need to avoid is the problem exposed in the following example: subgraph sub0 { node [color=red]; a; b; c; } subgraph sub1 { node [shape=diamond]; a; b; c; } We don't want to reset a,b,c to color=black just because that is default in sub1.\nHow do I get font and color changes in record labels or other labels? This is not possible in record shapes. However, you can do this using HTML-like labels.\nIn -Tplain format, splines do not touch the nodes (arrowheads are missing). Edges are specified as the main spline and, if necessary, arrowheads which actually abut the node. If the arrowheads are not given, drawing the edge spline will leave a gap between the edge and the node. This is a bug which has now solidified into a feature. A workaround is to set edge [dir=none]. Since the edges have no arrowheads, the spline specification will go all the way to both nodes.\nRecord nodes are drawn differently in dot and neato when rankdir=LR. It's true. dot -Grankdir=LR rotates record nodes so that their top level fields are still listed across levels. rankdir=LR has no effect in neato. One workaround is to use HTML-like labels (they don't rotate; the downside is that you have to write in XML). In general, we recommend replacing record nodes with the much more general HTML-like labels. Another workaround is to enclose record labels in { } to rotate/unrotate the record contents. See also, How To Avoid Foolish Consistency by Scott Berkun (Microsoft Corp.)\nHow can I print a big graph on multiple pages? The page attribute, if set, tells Graphviz to print the graph as an array of pages of the given size. Thus, the graph\ndigraph G { page=\"8.5,11\"; ... } will be emitted as 8.5 by 11 inch pages. When printed, the pages can be tiled to make a drawing of the entire graph. At present, the feature only works with PostScript output.\nAlternatively, there are various tools and viewers which will take a large picture and allow you to extract page-size pieces, which can then be printed. See also the viewport attribute.\nWhen I have a red edge it shows up as a solid red in PNG and GIF formats, but has a black border when rendered to JPEG. This is an artifact of JPEG's lossy compression algorithm. JPEG isn't very good for line drawings. Consider using PNG.\nSometimes in dotty, right mouse click shows the global menu but none of the items can be selected. Check that the NUMLOCK key is off. It's a known bug.\nWhy does dotty report a syntax error on a legal dot file? The dotty tool is deprecated, but this entry is retained to aid anyone still using it.\nTypically this error is reported as:\n\u003e\u003e graph parser: syntax error near line 14 \u003e\u003e context: \u003e\u003e\u003e \u003c\u003c\u003c digraph G { \u003e\u003e dotty.lefty: giving up on dot \u003e\u003e dotty.lefty: graph that causes dot \u003e\u003e dotty.lefty: to fail has been saved in file dottybug.dot Probably there is a command in your shell environment (such as .alias or .profile) that does output even for non-interactive shells. When this occurs, those characters go in the pipe to the dot parser and cause this problem. An easy check is whether other users have the same problem.\nHow can I get rid of the little circles on edges (\"edge handles\") in dotty? The dotty tool is deprecated, but this entry is retained to aid anyone still using it.\nEdit the file dotty.lefty and change the line that says: 'edgehandles' = 1; to 'edgehandles' = 0; it's around line 110.\nI already have all the coordinates for the nodes and edges of my graph and just want to use dot, neato, or dotty to render it. How? Put the graph with layout attributes into a dot file. Then run neato -n2. For example:\n$ neato -n2 -Tgif file.dot -o file.gif Note that if an edge does not have a pos attribute defined, neato will perform whatever edge routing it would normally do. All of the usual backend attributes (size, overlap, page, etc.) are available.\nI already have all the coordinates for the nodes, and I want dot or neato to route the edges. Run neato -n. This will add the necessary edge information.\nI already have all the coordinates for the nodes and edges of my graph and just want to use dotty to render it. How? If you want to do a layout first, use -Txdot for the output format. Dotty uses the layout information provided there.\nSame as above, but I have only node coords, not edges. Run neato -Txdot -n. This will add the necessary edge information.\nHow can I make client-side image maps? Use the -Tcmapx command line option. See here for more details.\nWhy aren't my server-side maps being recognized? I've checked the HTML! Make sure that your server has map files enabled. For example, if running apache, check that httpd.conf has a line like the following:\nAddHandler imap-file map and that it is not commented out!\nI've installed Debian Graphviz and it works fine on the command line, but when I execute a Perl/CGI script through Apache, no output is generated. For example, the code system(\"/usr/local/bin/dot -Tpng /tmp/tree.dot -o /tmp/tree.png\"); produces no file /tmp/tree.png.\nAs best as we can tell, dot dies with no stdout or stderr messages on Debian systems when run from an Apache cgi program with no HOME set. The workaround is to provide a HOME directory in the Apache userid's environment.\nSomeone has also suggested using the Perl module for Graphviz.\nGreg Brauer from Dreamworks pointed out a different possibility: The problem turned out to be that I was not closing the file descriptor on my temporary dot file before running dot. Graphviz would end up getting a newly-created empty file with nothing in it before the write buffer to the file was flushed. Dot would happily run on that and generate an empty output file without any warnings.\nHow can I get 3D output? The Graphviz authors have qualms about the gratuitous use of 3D.\nNonetheless, dot -Tvrml generates VRML files. There's no Z coordinate layout - you specify Z coords yourself in the z attribute of nodes, and the Z coordinates of edges are interpolated. If someone contributes a driver for a newer, more useful format (OpenGL Performer scene graphs? Open Scene Graphs? Java3D programs?) we'd like to try it.\nneato internally supports layouts in higher dimensions through the dim and dimen attributes, e.g. neato -Gdim=7. Graphviz output handles 2D and 3D, but there's no way to get higher-dimensional output unless you invoke neato as a library and inspect ND_pos(n)[i] where n is a pointer to the relevant node.\nProblems How can I avoid node overlaps in neato? Use the graph attribute overlap.\nHow can I avoid node-edge overlaps in neato? Use the overlap attribute to leave room among the nodes, then use -Gsplines=true.\n$ neato -Goverlap=... -Gsplines=true -Gsep=.1 The sep argument is the node-edge separation as a ratio of a node's bounding box. That is, sep=.1 means each node is treated as though it is 1.1 times larger than it is. The actual value may require some tinkering. (Don't ask why this isn't just a constant!) Note that this option really slows down neato, so should be used sparingly and only with modest-sized graphs.\ncause a crash? This usually happens when the Graphviz library is built using one version of the stdio library, and the user's program is compiled using another. If the FILE structure of stdio is different, the call to agread() will cause a crash. This is mainly a problem on Windows where we just provide a binary release built with one version of Visual Studio and stdio changes depending on the version of Visual Studio. It can also occur if the user tries to use cygwin or something similar which may also use an incompatible stdio.\nThe simplest solution is to read in the entire graph into memory, and pass a pointer to that memory to agmemread().\nIf that is not possible (e.g., the file is too large), you need to tell agread() to use a reader compatible with the stream you give it. By default, agread assumes you are passing it a FILE* generated by the version of stdio that was used to compile Graphviz, and uses that version of fgets to read the stream. To pass in your own reader, use the third argument:\nAgdisc_t mydisc; Agodisc_t myiodisc; mydisc.mem = NULL; // use system default mydisc.id = NULL; // use system default mydisc.io = \u0026myiodisc; myiodisc.afread = reader; myiodisc.putstr = NULL; // only need to set if calling gvRender() myiodisc.flush = NULL; // only need to set if calling gvRender() The reader function has type\nint (*reader) (void *chan, char *buf, int bufsize); and should act like the read() system call. That is, it reads from the stream chan, storing the bytes in buf, whose size is bufsize, and returns the number of bytes it read.\nFor Unix-like stdio, one might use\nstatic int reader(void *chan, char *buf, int bufsize) { return fread(buf, 1, bufsize, (FILE*)chan); } Then, to read the graph, use:\nFILE* fp = fopen (\"mygraph.gv\",\"r\"); Agraph_t* g = agread (fp, \u0026mydisc); Neato runs forever on a certain example. First, how big is your graph? Neato is a quadratic algorithm, roughly equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling. If you feed it a graph with thousands of nodes and edges, it can easily take hours or days. The first thing to check is to run neato -v to get a trace of the output. If the numbers you see are generally getting smaller, the layout is just taking a long time. You can set certain parameters, such as epsilon or maxiter to shorten the layout time, at the expense of layout quality. But if your graph is big, who's going to notice?\nAlternatively, use sfdp to layout the graph (though at present, sfdp does not honor edge lengths).\nIf you use mode=KK with neato or an early version, it is possible the optimization may cycle. If you see the numbers repeating, or fluctuating up and down, then neato is cycling, especially if your graph is small. This should never happen by default for versions later than 1.13. If it does, please report it as a bug.\nIf you are using an earlier version of neato, or you used mode=KK, cycling is indeed possible. This cycling is very sensitive to the initial layout. By using the start attribute, for example,\n$ neato -Gstart=3 $ neato -Gstart=rand the cycling will most likely disappear. Or you can employ the parameters used for large graphs to stop the layout earlier:\n$ neato -Gepsilon=.01 $ neato -Gmaxiter=500 Note that, if you have a large graph, the generation of edges as splines is a cubic algorithm, so you would do well to avoid using splines=true. (This comment applies to circo, fdp and twopi as well.)\nEdge label placement in dot is bad, or the layout is very convoluted. By default, edge labels in dot are modeled as dummy nodes. This guarantees adequate space for the labels, but for complicated graphs, this can dramatically distort the layout. In this case, it might be worthwhile to replace edge labels with xlabels. In this case, the graph is laid out as if there are no edge labels, with the labels added after the edges have been routed. This can prevent a contorted drawing at the expense of possibly have edge labels overlapping.\nDot runs forever on a certain example. Try dot -v to observe its progress.\nNote that it's possible to make graphs whose layout or even parsing is quadratic in the input size. For example, in dot,\ndigraph G { a -\u003e b -\u003e c -\u003e .... -\u003e x -\u003e y -\u003e z a -\u003e z b -\u003e z c -\u003e z /* and so on... */ x -\u003e z } The total edge length (therefore the layout time) of this as a ranked graph is quadratic in the number of nodes. You probably won't encounter the following, but it is also possible to construct graphs whose parsing takes quadratic time in the number of attributes, by appending attributes to nodes and edges after the graph has been loaded. For example:\ndigraph G { /* really big graph goes here...with N+1 nodes */ n0 -\u003e n1 -\u003e ... -\u003e nN; n0 [attr0=\"whatever\", attr1=\"something else\", /* and so on with many more attributes */ attrM=\"something again\"] } When an attribute first appears, each object is visited with possible cost proportional to the number of previously declared attributes. Thus, the running time for the above would be cN*O(M) for some constant c. If there is any concern about this, the graph should specify the attributes first before declaring nodes or edges. In practice, this problem is negligible.\nTwopi runs forever on a certain example. If your graph is large (many thousands of edges), and you set splines=true, it takes a lot of cycles to fit all those splines!\nNeato has unnecessary edge crossings, or has missed an obvious chance to make a much nicer layout. Neato and all similar virtual physical model algorithms rely on heuristic solutions of optimization problems. The better the solution, the longer it takes to find. Unfortunately, it is also possible for these heuristics to get stuck in local minima. Also, it is heavily influenced by the initial position of the nodes. It is quite possible that if you run neato again, but with a different random seed value, or more iterations, you'll get a better layout. For example:\n$ neato -Gstart=5 file.dot -Tps -o file.ps $ neato -Gepsilon=.0000001 file.dot -Tps -o file.ps In the default stress majorization mode of neato, using -Gstart=self can help produce a better initial layout.\nNote that there are no guarantees that neato will produce a planar layout of a planar graph, or expose all or most of a graph's symmetries.\nWebdot doesn't work. We assume you're using Apache and have TCL installed. If you don't, it's probably better to just use the webdot perl script.\nTo debug webdot, first test whether tclsh can load the Tcldot shared library. Try:\n$ tclsh % load $prefix/lib/graphviz/tcl/libtcldot.so.0 % where $prefix is the installation prefix for graphviz; usually /usr or /usr/local.\nThen test whether webdot runs from a shell command. (With webdot we provide a helper script scaffold.tcl or scaffold.sh that sets up an environment like the one Apache provides.) For example\n$ scaffold.tcl \u003eout.gif can't read \"LIBTCLDOT\": no such variable while executing \"file mtime $LIBTCLDOT\" invoked from within \"set t1 [file mtime $LIBTCLDOT]\" (file \"cgi-bin/webdot\" line 67) invoked from within \"source cgi-bin/webdot \" (file \"scaffold.tcl\" line 22) The above is a strong clue that webdot is not configured properly.\nFinally, test whether webdot runs as a cgi-bin program. It may help to examine the cgi-bin environment using a simple cgi-bin tcl script like:\n#!/bin/env tclsh puts \"Content-type: text/plain\" puts \"\" foreach e [lsort [array names env]] {puts \"$e: $env($e)\"} Save this script as .../cgi-bin/test.tcl, make it executable, then look at: http://localhost/cgi-bin/test.tcl\nAlso, if you see something like:\nWebDot Error: Response Code = 403 This usually means that webdot ran successfully, but was not able to fetch the remote graph from the URL you gave as an argument. The reason is probably that your server is behind a firewall that blocks the webdot server, so it cannot get the graph file. You can either change firewall permissions, put the graph on a different server, or install webdot locally so you don't need a remote server to fetch your graph data.\nIt would be nice if someone hacked webdot to take the contents of a graph as a cgi-bin argument, so it wouldn't need permission to fetch a graph remotely. This is left as an exercise for the Open Source Community.\nI have \"Font not found\" errors, or text labels missing in webdot. Firstly, recent versions of graphviz will use fontconfig if it is available on your platform. With fontconfig, this error should not occur, so you may want to see if an upgrade to graphviz is available, or if a rebuild will add fontconfig support.\nIf fontconfig is not available then graphviz tries to resolve fontnames to fontpaths itself, and uses DOTFONTPATH (or GDFONTPATH) to indicate where it should look.\nFor copyright reasons, Graphviz doesn't come with its own fonts. On a Windows machine, it knows to search in C:\\Windows\\Fonts. On a Unix machine, you need to set up a directory that contains Truetype fonts. You can get a copy of some fonts here.\nThe default DOTFONTPATH is:\n#define DEFAULT_FONTPATH \"/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType:/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype:/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF:/usr/share/fonts/TrueType:/usr/share/fonts/truetype:/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType:/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1\" If your fonts are somewhere else, then you must set that directory in the webdot script, or recompile Graphviz with the correct DEFAULT_FONTPATH (or set fontpath=\"/your/font/directory\" in every graph you lay out, but that's pretty clumsy.)\nYou can also try to comment the line #set SIGNATURE \"Graph by WebDot\" in /var/www/cgi-bin/webdot.\nWhat is the coordinate transformation between the graph bb and a .png image? The bb is expanded by 4 graph-units in all directions (pad) to allow for finite line widths. Then it is zoomed and/or rotated according to -Gviewport, -Gsize, -Glandscape, -Gorientation options. At the default scaling of 1:1, one graph unit = 1 point (1/72 inch). Then it is paginated, if requested by -Gpage and if the output format supports it. Not the -Tpng renderer, yet. Then a margin is added, -Gmargin, in absolute units (inches). The top/bottom margin can be set independently of the left/right margin. Then it is converted to device units, according to -Gdpi, or a dpi value that is given by the output device, or a default that is provided by each render. There are separate dpi values for x and y to allow for non-square pixels. Some renderers invert the Y axis and need an offset to place the origin in the top left corner. The default dpi for -Tpng is 96dpi (approximating the resolution of most computer monitors) so this is where the scaling by 96/72 (4/3) comes from. At the renderer api, plugins have a choice of coordinate representation:\ncoordinates in graph-units, and composite transformation data consisting of: scaling, rotation, and translation. (used by svg, cairo, ps, renderers) coordinates pre-transformed into device units.

Most, if not all of these are optional, and configure will build graphviz with reduced functionality if an external library is not found. Newer versions of these libraries should be fine - if not, please let us know.\nA list of these external libraries can be found on the Graphviz source download page.\nNotes GD (generic raster graphics driver for PNG, GIF, JPEG) ZLIB (raster image compression) NB: Use ./configure -s to build shared libraries. (See notes in zlib-1.2.3/Makefile) These libraries (either static or dynamic) and their interface header files must already be on your system. It's OK if you install your own copies of these packages, though you may need to tell make or configure where to find them. Run configure --help for details.\nOn most Linux distributions these packages are already installed or installable from packages included in the distribution. You might need to install some -devel packages to get the include header files. Also, some of these packages require other packages, so for sanity, you should use some automated install mechanism such as rpms or macports, or look for complete packages.\nAbbreviated Build Instructions The recommended method for building graphviz from a downloaded source package is the usual:\n./configure make make install If you are building from Git sources, then you must have recent versions of libtool, libltdl-dev, automake, and autoconf. Build with:\n./autogen.sh make make install autogen.sh accepts the same options as the configure script that it generates for subsequent use.\nDetailed Build Instructions The preferred image renderer is cairo, with support from pango for fonts. This handles various bitmap formats as well as svg, pdf and PostScript.\nThe generic raster driver is gd and it can be configured to generate GIF (no compression), PNG (lossless compression), JPEG (lossy compression), and wireless bitmap (WBMP) files. The compressors all need zlib. In the current build, we use a top-level config.h file that defines various symbols, such as:\nHAVE_JPEG HAVE_PNG This file is typically generated by configure based on how you invoke it and what it finds on your system.\nIf you don't enable the gd based drivers, graphviz will still have the printf style drivers for PostScript and SVG. (However, even these benefit from better text size estimation via Freetype, when it is available.)\nBuild tools for Unix Use configure generated by GNU autoconf. This comes with the source packages. This often works well on a vanilla Linux distribution with Tcl/Tk, freetype-devel and libjpeg already installed by root under /usr. It works OK with other versions of Unix, but some adjusting of command line arguments to configure may be needed. For Linux you can also just pick up the source tarball or RPMs here.\nFirst, if you are using sources from Git, run ./autogen.sh to generate the configure script. If you are using sources from graphviz-\u003cversion\u003e.tar.gz this autogen.sh step should not be needed.\nNext, run configure. For help on possible configure options, run:\n./configure --help For example, I use\n./configure --prefix=$HOME/arch/sgi.mips3 \\ --with-freetypeincludedir=$HOME/arch/$ARCH/include/freetype2 \\ --with-freetypelibdir=$HOME/arch/$ARCH/lib \\ --with-tcl=/usr/common/tcl8.3.3 Obviously you would change the pathnames to reflect your installation.\nNote that the directory ${prefix}/include is automatically searched for headers, and ${prefix}/lib for libraries.\nIf you have problems with one or more of the optional script language bindings, they can be disabled with e.g. --disable-perl.\nWhen configure is finished, it reports which optional packages were found and which Graphviz features are enabled. If some package or feature you expected is not shown as used, you may need to check the config.log file or configure.ac or configure files to see what went wrong. Usually, any problem can be resolved using environment variables or the command-line flags of configure.\nOnce configure has finished, complete the build with\ngmake gmake install Build tools for win32 See separate build notes for Microsoft Windows.\nWith some persistence you can likely get Graphviz to build on UWIN or Cygwin installed on Microsoft Windows. You will still need various third-party packages to enable all the Graphviz drivers.\nUnix platform-specific build notes Apple Mac OS/X Currently, Glen Low provides a full-featured port of Graphviz. Also, Ryan Schmidt maintains versions of Graphviz for macports.\nWe recommend using macports to install the desired third-party libraries. Once these have been installed, the standard build using configure and make works fine. The only caveat is that sometimes, an incompatible, non-GNU tool is picked up rather than the needed GNU version.\nCompiling Smyrna for OS X, Snow Leopard (Amanda Stent)\nXcode:\nFirst if you updated from Leopard you have to reinstall developer tools. No getting around it, I tried, you just have to do it.\nMacports:\nThen you have to uninstall and clean up the Macports ports, all of them. Take the opportunity to reinstall Macports itself. There are migration instructions on the web, but it's a little hairier than they make it out to be because some of the links (e.g. hs-ports) will not be there and you will have to get over those hurdles manually.\nBriefly, to do a clean install of macports do:\nsudo port -f uninstall installed sudo port clean --work --archive all and then new macports and then sudo port install the things you need now and possibly sudo port selfupdate and sudo port upgrade outdated at the end Then you have to install all the tools needed for Smyrna, glut, glade, etc., and all their dependencies. This takes days.\nNow macports doesn't do glut separately. It's sneaky because if you say install glut, something will happen, but actually glut now comes with mesa. This will mess up your head. (The real meat of glut is part of the mesa package - ed.)\nGraphviz:\nThen you get your graphviz and you configure with --with-smyrna. I used the following:\nconfigure --with-smyrna --with-glutincludedir=/opt/local/var/macports/software/mesa/7.6.1_1+hw_render/opt/local/include --with-glutlibdir=/opt/local/var/macports/software/mesa/7.6.1_1+hw_render/opt/local/lib --prefix=/usr/local/share/graphviz I use:\nconfigure --with-smyrna --with-glutincludedir=/opt/local/include --with-glutlibdir=/opt/local/lib On the webs they say to use -framework commandline option to gcc; however I couldn't figure out how to make this work with the makefile and configure file for graphviz.\nNow, I got to a certain point and it grumbled about permissions and refused to go any further. So you may have to chmod in the source directory.\nAnd I got to the point where it was building gv_perl.cpp and it refused to go any further. I got around this eventually by changing the call to XS to XSPROTO, thus obviating the need for XSUB.h (what does it do for you? nothing!).\nAnd then it said it was done but when I went to run it it wouldn't start due to some missing template.dot so then you make clean, and make install again because by now you are confused as well.\nAnd then it should work!\nBy the way making by sneakily cd'ing into the macosx folder and using the makefile labeled with your OS does not work.\nAIX Matt Fago tells us that --enable-shared=no is required or the executables segfault after seemingly correct compiles.

Thus, these values have the form \"#RGB\" or \"#RGBA\", where R, G, B, and A each consist of 2 hexadecimal digits, and can be separated by whitespace. HSV colors have the form of 3 numbers between 0 and 1, separated by whitespace or commas.\nString-valued color specifications are case-insensitive and interpreted in the context of the current color scheme, as specified by the colorscheme attribute. If this is undefined, the X11 naming scheme will be used. An initial \"/\" character can be used to override the use of the colorscheme attribute. In particular, a single initial \"/\" will cause the string to be evaluated using the default X11 naming. If the color value has the form \"/ssss/yyyy\", the name yyyy is interpreted using the schema ssss. If the color scheme name is empty, i.e., the color has the form \"//yyyy\", the colorscheme attribute is used. Thus, the forms \"yyyy\" and \"//yyyy\" are equivalent.\nAt present, Graphviz recognizes the default color scheme X11, and the Brewer color schemes (cf. ColorBrewer).

It reproduces the input, along with layout information for the graph. In particular, a bb attribute is attached to the graph, specifying the bounding box of the drawing. If the graph has a label, its position is specified by the lp attribute.\nEach node gets pos, width and the record rectangles are given in the rects attribute. If the node is a polygon and the vertices attribute is defined, this attribute contains the vertices of the node.\nEvery edge is assigned a pos attribute, and if the edge has a label, the label position is given in lp.\nExample: simple graph, outputting layout positioning with -Tdot $ echo 'digraph { a-\u003eb }' | dot -Tdot digraph { graph [bb=\"0,0,54,108\"]; node [label=\"\\N\"]; a [height=0.5, pos=\"27,90\", width=0.75]; b [height=0.5, pos=\"27,18\", width=0.75]; a -\u003e b [pos=\"e,27,36.104 27,71.697 27,63.983 27,54.712 27,46.112\"]; } xdot The xdot format extends the dot format by providing much more detailed information about how graph components are drawn. It relies on additional attributes for nodes, edges and graphs.\nSee also xdot attribute type docs\nThe format is fluid; comments and suggestions for better representations are welcome. To allow for changes in the format, Graphviz attaches the attribute xdotversion to the graph. If the xdotversion attribute is set in the input graph, the renderer will only output features supported by that version. Note that the formats xdot1.2 and xdot1.4 are equivalent to setting xdotversion=1.2 and xdotversion=1.4, respectively.\nAdditional drawing attributes can appear on nodes, edges, clusters and on the graph itself. There are six new attributes:\nAttribute Description Limitations draw General drawing without labels ldraw Label drawing hdraw Head arrowhead Edge only tdraw Tail arrowhead Edge only hldraw Head label Edge only tldraw Tail label Edge only For a given graph object, one will typically issue a draw directive before the label directive. For example, for a node, one would first use the commands in draw followed by the commands in ldraw.\nThe value of these attributes consists of the concatenation of some (multi-)set of the following 13 rendering or attribute operations. (The number is parentheses gives the xdot version when the operation was added to the format. If no version number is given, the operation was in the original specification.)\nE x₀ y₀ w h Filled ellipse ((x-x₀)/w)² + ((y-y₀)/h)² = 1 e x₀ y₀ w h Unfilled ellipse ((x-x₀)/w)² + ((y-y₀)/h)² = 1 P n x₁ y₁ ... xₙ yₙ Filled polygon using the given n points p n x₁ y₁ ... xₙ yₙ Unfilled polygon using the given n points L n x₁ y₁ ... xₙ yₙ Polyline using the given n points B n x₁ y₁ ... xₙ yₙ B-spline using the given n control points b n x₁ y₁ ... xₙ yₙ Filled B-spline using the given n control points (1.1) T x y j w n -b₁b₂...bₙ Text drawn using the baseline point (x,y). The text consists of the n bytes following -. The text should be left-aligned (centered, right-aligned) on the point if j is -1 (0, 1), respectively. The value w gives the width of the text as computed by the library. t f Set font characteristics. The integer f is the OR of: Flag Value Min-Version BOLD 1 ITALIC 2 UNDERLINE 4 SUPERSCRIPT 8 SUBSCRIPT 16 (1.5) STRIKE_THROUGH 32 (1.6) OVERLINE 64 (1.7) C n -b₁b₂...bₙ Set fill color. The color value consists of the n bytes following -. (1.1) c n -b₁b₂...bₙ Set pen color. The color value consists of the n bytes following -. (1.1) F s n -b₁b₂...bₙ Set font. The font size is s points. The font name consists of the n bytes following -. (1.1) S n -b₁b₂...bₙ Set style attribute. The style value consists of the n bytes following -. The syntax of the value is the same as specified for a styleItem in style. (1.1) I x y w h n -b₁b₂...bₙ Externally-specified image drawn in the box with lower left corner (x,y) and upper right corner (x+w,y+h). The name of the image consists of the n bytes following -. This is usually a bitmap image. Note that the image size, even when converted from pixels to points, might be different from the required size (w,h). It is assumed the renderer will perform the necessary scaling. (1.2) Note that the filled figures (ellipses, polygons and B-Splines) imply two operations: first, drawing the filled figure with the current fill color; second, drawing an unfilled figure with the current pen color, pen width and pen style.\nWithin the context of a single drawing attribute, e.g., draw, there is an implicit state for the graphical attributes. That is, once a color, style, font, or font characteristic is set, it remains valid for all relevant drawing operations until the value is reset by another xdot cmd.\nStyle values which can be incorporated in the graphics model do not appear in xdot output. In particular, the style values filled, rounded, diagonals, and invis will not appear. Indeed, if style contains invis, there will not be any xdot output at all.\nWith version 1.4 of xdot, color strings may now encode linear and radial gradients. Linear gradients have the form '[' x₀ y₀ x₁ y₁ n [color-stop]⁺ ']'\nwhere (x₀,y₀) and (x₁,y₁) define the starting and ending points of the gradient line segment, and n gives the number of color-stops. Each color-stop has the form\nv m -b₁b₂...bₘ\nwhere v is a number in the range [0,1] defining a position on the gradient line segment, with color specified by the m byte string b₁b₂...bₘ, the same format as used for colors in the 'c' and 'C' operations.\nRadial gradients have the form\n'(' x₀ y₀ r₀ x₁ y₁ r₁ n [color-stop]⁺ ')' where xⱼ yⱼ rⱼ, for j=0,1, specify the center and radius of the start and ending circle, and n gives the number of color-stops. A color-stop has the same format as defined for linear gradients, again given the fractional offset and its associated color.\nIn handling text alignment, the application may want to recompute the string width using its own rendering primitives.\nThe text operation is only used in the label attributes. Normally, the non-text operations are only used in the non-label attributes. If, however, the decorate attribute is set on an edge, its label attribute will also contain a polyline operation. In addition, if a label is a complex, HTML-like label, it will also contain non-text operations.\nAll coordinates and sizes are in points. Note though that if an edge or node is invisible, no drawing operations are attached to it.\nVersion info:\nXdot version Graphviz version Modification \u003e1.0 1.9 \u003e1.1 2.8 First plug-in version \u003e1.2 2.13 Support image operator I \u003e1.3 2.31 Add numerical precision \u003e1.4 2.32 Add gradient colors \u003e1.5 2.34 Fix text layout problem; fix inverted vector in gradient; support version-specific output; new t op for text characteristics \u003e1.6 2.35 Add STRIKE-THROUGH bit fort \u003e1.7 2.37 Add OVERLINE for t Example: simple graph, outputting layout positioning \u0026 drawing information with -Txdot $ echo 'digraph { a-\u003eb }' | dot -Txdot digraph { graph [_draw_=\"c 9 -#fffffe00 C 7 -#ffffff P 4 0 0 0 108 54 108 54 0 \", bb=\"0,0,54,108\", xdotversion=1.7 ]; node [label=\"\\N\"]; a [_draw_=\"c 7 -#000000 e 27 90 27 18 \", _ldraw_=\"F 14 11 -Times-Roman c 7 -#000000 T 27 86.3 0 7 1 -a \", height=0.5, pos=\"27,90\", width=0.75]; b [_draw_=\"c 7 -#000000 e 27 18 27 18 \", _ldraw_=\"F 14 11 -Times-Roman c 7 -#000000 T 27 14.3 0 7 1 -b \", height=0.5, pos=\"27,18\", width=0.75]; a -\u003e b [_draw_=\"c 7 -#000000 B 4 27 71.7 27 63.98 27 54.71 27 46.11 \", _hdraw_=\"S 5 -solid c 7 -#000000 C 7 -#000000 P 3 30.5 46.1 27 36.1 23.5 46.1 \", pos=\"e,27,36.104 27,71.697 27,63.983 27,54.712 27,46.112\"]; } ","categories":"","description":"Graphviz Language","excerpt":"Graphviz Language","ref":"/docs/outputs/canon/","tags":"","title":"DOT"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"A customizable graph editor.","excerpt":"A customizable graph editor.","ref":"/docs/cli/dotty/","tags":"","title":"dotty"},{"body":"See Wikipedia: Double-precision floating-point format.\n","categories":"","description":"Double-precision floating point number","excerpt":"Double-precision floating point number","ref":"/docs/attr-types/double/","tags":"","title":"double"},{"body":"A colon-separated list of doubles: \"%f(:%f)*\" where each %f is a double.\n","categories":"","description":"List of [`doubles`](/docs/attr-types/double/)","excerpt":"List of [`doubles`](/docs/attr-types/double/)","ref":"/docs/attr-types/doubleList/","tags":"","title":"doubleList"},{"body":"For bitmap output, dpi guarantees that text rendering will be done more accurately, both in size and in placement.\nFor SVG output, dpi guarantees the dimensions in the output correspond to the correct number of points or inches.\n","categories":"","description":"Specifies the expected number of pixels per inch on a display device","excerpt":"Specifies the expected number of pixels per inch on a display device","ref":"/docs/attrs/dpi/","tags":"","title":"dpi"},{"body":"See also:\nedgehref, edgeURL headhref, headURL labelhref, labelURL tailhref, tailURL href, URL ","categories":"","description":"Synonym for [`edgeURL`](/docs/attrs/edgeURL)","excerpt":"Synonym for [`edgeURL`](/docs/attrs/edgeURL)","ref":"/docs/attrs/edgehref/","tags":"","title":"edgehref"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Edge coloring to disambiguate crossing edges.","excerpt":"Edge coloring to disambiguate crossing edges.","ref":"/docs/cli/edgepaint/","tags":"","title":"edgepaint"},{"body":"If the edge has a URL or edgeURL attribute, edgetarget determines which window of the browser is used for the URL attached to the non-label part of the edge.\nSetting edgetarget=_graphviz will open a new window if it doesn't already exist, or reuse it if it does.\nIf undefined, the value of the target is used instead.\n","categories":"","description":"Browser window to use for the [`edgeURL`](/docs/attrs/edgeURL/) link","excerpt":"Browser window to use for the [`edgeURL`](/docs/attrs/edgeURL/) link","ref":"/docs/attrs/edgetarget/","tags":"","title":"edgetarget"},{"body":" headtooltip. labeltooltip. tailtooltip. tooltip.

The naming and rendering of text fonts in Graphviz (and other programs) is complicated. There are several reasons:\nGraphviz runs on a wide range of systems: Linux and other Unix variants, Microsoft Windows, and Mac. Graphviz has a wide range of output formats: raster-oriented formats like PNG and GIF; path-based ones like Postscript, PDF and SVG; some idiosyncractic legacy formats, like troff PIC. Often, output will be downloaded and displayed on a computer or other device, different than the one where the layout was created. Graphviz layouts should be identical in size and appearance, regardless of the output format. Graphviz can run on external libraries that help with naming and rendering text fonts, but they are not required, and stripped-down Graphviz tools can be built without them. In fact, Graphviz may have to run on systems with no font files installed. There are several major font file formats to be supported. Non-Western, international character sets should be supported. Graphviz should provide a good set of standard fonts. It should be easy to specify standard fonts. Users should be able to load their own custom fonts. Output should be small to download quickly. Output should allow the best rendering possible in a given format. Output files should be easy to postprocess, for example, retaining the objects of the original graph if possible. It is very helpful to work around known bugs or missing features in support libraries and popular external tools. This is a tall order. Some of the goals conflict. Generally our approach has been to define defaults that favor convenience and good looking output, and give the user options to override the defaults.\nOverview In the following, we will assume a \"standard\" version of Graphviz with the full set of support libraries (fontconfig, gd, Cairo and Pango), running on a desktop system or server with a standard installation of font files.\nThe graphviz layout engines (dot, neato, etc) create layouts with nodes sized to enclose the text labels. This requires knowing the size of the text blocks, which in turn requires knowing the metrics of the font glyphs and their composition into words, taking into account wordspacing, kerning, hinting, etc. So the overall process is: font specification, then text layout, followed by Graphviz output (and final rendering on the target display or device, which may or may not be by a Graphviz tool).\nA font is usually selected by family name (fontname) and other properties (see below: \"Font selection\"). Then fontconfig matches the request to a system font.\nNote: in older versions of Graphviz, fontname was simply a file name. This required exact file name matching (with a little bit of helpful name mangling under the hood, e.g. translating Times-Roman to Times, or Helvetica to Arial on Windows systems (and yes, we know there is a difference). Under fontconfig, fontnames are family names, which fontconfig matches to the closest font it finds. This always \"succeeds\", but unfortunately produces surprising results if fontconfig's idea of \"close\" doesn't match yours. This can happen when you specify a custom (or just nonexistent) font, like Steve-North-Handwriting, and fontconfig silently falls back to something safe like a typewriter font.\nText layout is performed by pango, which accepts text and computes a layout with metrics that determine node sizes.\nThough line drawing is provided by cairo for many output formats (and likely more in the future), for raster output formats, font rendering is passed though cairo to freetype. Freetype is also called if gd is used for drawing. (gd can also be requested explicitly, e.g. dot -Tpng:gd, or by default when Graphviz is built without cairo). Freetype provides antialiasing, hinting, kerning, and other low-level font features.\nFont metrics are obtained from the fonts installed on the system running Graphviz. Results are guaranteed when Graphviz outputs raster formats, because freetype immediately renders the fonts into pixels. On the other hand, with path-based formats like Postscript (-Tps) and SVG (-Tsvg), final rendering may be done on a different platform altogether, with different font files installed. Clearly, Your Milage May Vary. In the case of Postscript, the driver in Graphviz passes the expected metrics of the text block down to the renderer, and asks it to make a final stretch (or squeeze) to force the text to fit the metrics that were in effect at layout time. In Graphviz SVG, there is only a hope and a prayer that the SVG rendering program's fonts match the ones fontconfig and freetype used when Graphviz was run. (More about this later.)\nDefault fonts and PostScript fonts The default font in graphviz is, and always has been, Times-Roman.\nGraphviz has historically supported some \"standard\" Postscript fonts, initially, Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. This list was later enlarged by Adobe to include 35 fonts, which are:\nAvantGarde-Book AvantGarde-BookOblique AvantGarde-Demi AvantGarde-DemiOblique Bookman-Demi Bookman-DemiItalic Bookman-Light Bookman-LightItalic Courier Courier-Bold Courier-BoldOblique Courier-Oblique Helvetica Helvetica-Bold Helvetica-BoldOblique Helvetica-Narrow Helvetica-Narrow-Bold Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique Helvetica-Narrow-Oblique Helvetica-Oblique NewCenturySchlbk-Bold NewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic NewCenturySchlbk-Italic NewCenturySchlbk-Roman Palatino-Bold Palatino-BoldItalic Palatino-Italic Palatino-Roman Symbol Times-Bold Times-BoldItalic Times-Italic Times-Roman ZapfChancery-MediumItalic ZapfDingbats Unfortunately, fontconfig doesn't recognize PostScript-style font names directly, so Graphviz makes custom mappings from its list of PostScipt names into fontconfig family names for use in all cairo and gd based renderers. In -Tps output, these fonts are used without name translation.\nFont selection The fontname attribute in .gv graphs is a fontconfig style specification.\nFrom: http://www.fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html\nFontconfig provides a textual representation for patterns that the library can both accept and generate. The representation is in three parts, first a family name list, second list of point sizes, and finally a list of additional properties:\n\u003cfamilies\u003e-\u003cpoint sizes\u003e:\u003cname1\u003e=\u003cvalues1\u003e:\u003cname2\u003e=\u003cvalues2\u003e...\nValues in a list are separated with commas. The name needn't include either a family or point size; they can be elided. In addition, there are symbolic constants that simultaneously indicate both a name and a value. Here are some examples:\nName Meaning Times-12 12 point Times Roman Times-12:bold 12 point Times Bold Courier:italic Courier Italic in the default size Monospace:matrix=1 .1 0 1 The users preferred monospace font with artificial obliquing Graphviz currently has a separate attribute for specififying fontsize.\nTODO: We should allow the fontconfig style specification. Times-20 does not currently result in a 20pt font. This is probably because of special treatment of - for postscript font names.\nTODO: We seem to have a bug with use of : in fontnames, probably because of special treatment for filenames in Windows. In fontnames, use \u003cspace\u003e instead of : to separate values. -Nfontname=\"Courier:italic\" doesn't produce an italic font in graphviz-2.16.1, but: -Nfontname=\"Courier italic\" works, but -Nfontname=\"Monospace matrix=1 .1 0 1\" doesn't.\nFont management with fontconfig How can I tell what fonts are available? $ fc-list How can I tell what fonts dot is using? $ dot foo.gv -Tpng -o foo.png -v 2\u003e\u00261 | grep font How can I add a custom font? In the current version of Graphviz with fontconfig, Cairo and Pango, this cannot be done by simply putting a file in the current directory or setting the DOTFONTPATH path variable. Your custom font must be explicitly installed by fontconfig tools.\nFor a single font, e.g., foo.ttf:\n$ mkdir -p ~/.fonts $ cp foo.ttf ~/.fonts/ One can run fc-cache to speed up the use of fontconfig.\n$ fc-cache For Windows users, one can go to the C:\\windows\\fonts folder and use File -\u003e Install New Font from the pull-down menus to install the font.\nFor a new font directory, e.g., /Library/Fonts, add a new \u003cdir\u003e element\n\u003cdir\u003e/Library/Fonts\u003c/dir\u003e to a .conf file. Note that the file must have a correct xml structure as specified by the fontconfig fonts.dtd. Possible choices for the .conf file are local.conf in the same directory as the system-wide fonts.conf file, or .fonts.conf in your home directory.\nHow can I ... font? See: http://www.fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html\nCan I specifiy a font by filename instead of by familyname? Sorry, the answer is no. (The reason is that for this to work, Graphviz has to intercept the font lookup before fontconfig is called, and this can't be done when fonts are being looked up by Pango.)\nSome versions of fontconfig appear to recognize pathnames and attempt to use that, but this isn't always the case.\nHow can I be sure that a specific font is selected? Provide enough specification in the fontname, and test it with fc-match to ensure that your desired font is selected. (Note, this will not ensure that the same font is used in -Tps or -Tsvg renderings where we rely on the fonts available on the final printer or computer.)\nNote the downside, as mentioned previously, is that Graphviz cannot do much to warn you when fontconfig didn't find a very good match, because fontconfig just cheerfully falls back to some standard font. It would be really nice if the fontconfig developers could provide a metric reflecting the quality of the font match in their API.\nWhat about SVG fonts? Graphviz has a native SVG driver that we wrote (which is the default), and cairo's SVG driver (which you get with -Tsvg:cairo).\nGraphviz' native SVG driver generates Windows compliant names like Times New Roman or Arial by default. The names work in a lot of situations (like Firefox running on Windows), but are not guaranteed to be portable. If you set -Gfontnames=ps, you get Postscript names like Times-Roman. If you set -Gfontnames=svg you are guaranteed to get rock solid standards compliant SVG. The SVG standard says that the legal generic font names are Serif, Sans-Serif, and Monospace (plus Cursive and Fantasy which we don't use in Graphviz). We generate those names. The bad news is that various downstream renderers and editors may resolve the generic font names differently, so it's not quite clear how your SVG will look. Many W3C examples show how to use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to get around this problem by giving a list of font family names in order of lookup precedence, but some downstream processors (like the inkscape editor in Linux) don't implement CSS, so we're up a tree here.\nThe cairo SVG driver solves this in an effective though brute force way: it simply encodes embeds the needed fonts as lines and curves in the target SVG. For small examples, -Tsvg:cairo is about 10 times bigger than -Tsvg, but maybe it's worth it for correctness. The other problem is that such SVG is much much slower to render, no doubt because it bypasses any system font rendering services, and does it the old fashioned way.\nWhat about Postscript fonts? TODO: say something here. What about non-ASCII like Latin1? What about loading your own fonts via -L like in the old days with the weird outline font example.\n\"What if\" issues for nonstandard Graphviz builds The following only apply if you build your own version of Graphviz by configuring and compiling the source code to build your own custom executable. If you don't know what this means, it definitely does not mean you.\nNo freetype When graphviz is built on systems without freetype, then only the gd renderer will be available for bitmap outputs, and the only available fonts are a small set of builtin bitmap fonts. The poor quality of these fonts will be evident, also, dot ... -v 2\u003e\u00261 | grep font will say that the font is \u003cinternal\u003e. This may actually be desirable for installing minimal graphviz programs on a server where fonts may not even be installed.\nNo fontconfig If graphviz is built on systems without fontconfig (e.g. Redhat-7) then the fontname attribute will be interpreted as a font file name. The system directories will be searched for this, or the directories can be specified with the GDFONTPATH environment variable (or DOTFONTPATH for historical reasons). Graphviz will use gd and freetype to obtain metrics and render text. No pango/cairo renderers will be available without fontconfig support.\nDisabling fontconfig Pango/cairo depends on fontconfig, so to disable fontconfig you also have to disable pango/cairo. The easiest way to do this temporarily is to edit /usr/lib/graphviz/config and remove the entire libpango block.\nNote that any changes to this file will be lost the next time graphviz is updated, or dot -c is run with installer privileges.\nWith pango disabled, graphviz will use gd which, even if it was built with fontconfig support, will still allow fontnames to be given as filenames.\nYou can also disable cairopango at build time with configure script options.\nNo gd Cairopango works without gd. We are moving graphviz to the pango/cairo libraries, but gd still offers some features that are hard to replace, such as JPEGs, GIFs and paletted color bitmap outputs. However, font support is fully functional without gd so long as pango, cairo, fontconfig, freetype are available.\nNo pango/cairo Without pango/cairo, some of the key renderers are only available with gd, which produces lower quality (but smaller) output.\nLooking forward, we expect to depend more on pango for things like: line wrapping, multiple fonts per label, bidirectional text and other internationalization features.\nNo gd and no cairopango This is basically the original Graphviz without any external fonts. It cannot render any raster formats, so it's mainly good for Postscript. It relies on a few internal font tables\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Before we launch into the gory details, we would like to explain why …","ref":"/faq/font/","tags":"","title":"Font FAQ"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Color used for text","excerpt":"Color used for text","ref":"/docs/attrs/fontcolor/","tags":"","title":"fontcolor"},{"body":"This very much depends on the output format and, for non-bitmap output such as PostScript or SVG, the availability of the font when the graph is displayed or printed. As such, it is best to rely on font faces that are generally available, such as Times-Roman, Helvetica or Courier.\nHow font names are resolved also depends on the underlying library that handles font name resolution. If Graphviz was built using the fontconfig library, the latter library will be used to search for the font. See the commands fc-list, fc-match and the other fontconfig commands for how names are resolved and which fonts are available. Other systems may provide their own font package, such as Quartz for OS X.\nNote that various font attributes, such as weight and slant, can be built into the font name. Unfortunately, the syntax varies depending on which font system is dominant. Thus, using fontname=\"times bold italic\" will produce a bold, slanted Times font using Pango, the usual main font library. Alternatively, fontname=\"times:italic\" will produce a slanted Times font from fontconfig, while fontname=\"times-bold\" will resolve to a bold Times using Quartz. You will need to ascertain which package is used by your Graphviz system and refer to the relevant documentation.\nIf Graphviz is not built with a high-level font library, fontname will be considered the name of a Type 1 or True Type font file. If you specify fontname=schlbk, the tool will look for a file named schlbk.ttf or schlbk.pfa or schlbk.pfb in one of the directories specified by the fontpath attribute.

It comes with a TCL/tk interface for tests and demos.\nThe library accepts as input:\ntwo endpoints\noptional endpoint tangent vectors\nan admissable region where a curve may be drawn to connect the endpoints\nIt returns a Bezier curve that connects the endpoints and stays within the admissable region. The curve is smooth and close to a shortest path.\nSpline-o-matic Solves Two Types of Problems In the first case, the input is a simple polygon, with the two endpoints must be inside it. The result curve stays within the control polygon.\nIn the second case, the input is a list of polygonal obstacles or \"holes\" to be avoided, along with the endpoints. The result curve does not pass through any obstacle . (If an endpoint is inside an obstacle, it is ignored for the given route. This is convenient for routing node-link diagrams.)\nCurves are routed individually, not globally, so the edge router does not prevent them from crossing. An interesting improvement to this library would be introduce some notion of global planning to prevent unwanted edge crossings. The library interface to Spline-o-matic exposes its main algorithms so they may be invoked independently for efficiency and flexibility.\nCurves are computed in two phases. The first phase finds a shortest path (a polyline) between endpoints. As described previously, there are two variants. Routing inside a polygon is solved by an efficient algorithm due to Overmars and Welzl, but routing around obstacles involves computing the visibility graph of the obstacles' vertices, for which we employ the standard O(N^3) algorithm. When more than one edge route is to be found, it is much faster to precompute and re-use the visibility graph, than to compute it for each route.\nThe second phase takes an arbitrary simple path (usually a shortest path computed by the first phase) and a list of barrier segments (usually sides of a control polygon or of obstacles) and produces a Bezier curve that does not touch a barrier except on an endpoint. Note that the barriers are not required to form polygons.\nHere is the library API. Polygons must always be presented in clockwise order!\n#include \u0026lt;pathgeom.h\u0026gt; /* open a visibility graph */ vconfig_t *Pobsopen(Ppoly_t **obstacles, int n_obstacles); /* close a visibility graph, freeing its storage */ void Pobsclose(vconfig_t *config); /* route a polyline from p0 to p1, avoiding obstacles. * if an endpoint is inside an obstacle, pass the polygon's index \u003e=0 * if the endpoint is not inside an obstacle, pass POLYID_NONE * if the endpoint location is not known, pass POLYID_UNKNOWN */ int Pobspath(vconfig_t *config, Ppoint_t p0, int poly0, Ppoint_t p1, int poly1, Ppolyline_t *output_route); #define POLYID_NONE\t-1111 #define POLYID_UNKNOWN\t-2222 /* find shortest euclidean path within a simple polygon */ extern int Pshortestpath(Ppoly_t *boundary, Ppoint_t endpoints[2], Ppolyline_t *output_route); /* fit a spline to an input polyline, without touching barrier segments */ extern int Proutespline (Pedge_t *barriers, int n_barriers, Ppolyline_t input_route, Pvector_t endpoint_slopes[2], Ppolyline_t *output_route); /* utility function to convert from a set of polygonal obstacles to barriers */ extern int Ppolybarriers(Ppoly_t **polys, int npolys, Pedge_t **barriers, int *n _barriers); #endif Distribution The source release is on our download page. Considerable software know-how is needed to work with it. The GUI is written in TCL. The path planner is built as a static library. The TCL layer includes this and other functions as a dynamic library.\nGUI The package has a C library interface and a TCL/tk GUI (contributed by John Ellson, ellson@research.att.com) for demos and debugging. Run pathtest.tcl (or tclsh pathtest.tcl). The GUI permits drawing obstacle polygons (use button 1 to place vertices and button 2 to place the last vertex of a polygon).\npathtest comes with a few sample obstacle configurations. To try it, run pathtest.tcl. load an example, click on the Bezier radio button, and use mouse button 1 and 2 to sweep a line segment. A curve will be routed between its endpoints. The choice of routing inside a polygon or routing around obstacles depends on the endpoints.\nReferences Implementing a General-purpose Edge Router: Paper, Quicktime video.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Spline-o-matic is an edge router that draws Bezier curves in …","ref":"/Misc/spline-o-matic/","tags":"","title":"Graphviz: Spline-o-Matic"},{"body":"Often an layout engine places nodes on undesired locations.

These can be used in a web page with a graphical form of the output, e.g. in JPEG, GIF or PNG format, to attach links to nodes and edges. Graphviz generates an object's map information only if the object has a non-trival URL or href attribute, or if it has an explicit tooltip attribute.\ncmap produces map files for client-side image maps. It's mostly identical to cmapx, but the latter is well-formed XML amenable to processing by XML tools. In particular, the cmapx output is wrapped in \u003cmap\u003e\u003c/map\u003e.\nimap_np and cmapx_np are identical to the imap and cmapx formats, except they rely solely on rectangles as active areas.\nismap is a predecessor (circa 1994) of the imap format. Most servers now use the latter.\nFor example, to create a server-side map given the dot file:\n/* x.gv */ digraph mainmap { URL=\"http://www.research.att.com/base.html\"; command [URL=\"http://www.research.att.com/command.html\"]; command -\u003e output [URL=\"colors.html\"]; } Edit in Playground one would process the graph and generate two output files:\ndot -Timap -ox.map -Tgif -ox.gif x.gv and then refer to it in a web page:\n\u003cA HREF=\"x.map\"\u003e\u003cIMG SRC=\"x.gif\" ismap=\"ismap\" /\u003e\u003c/A\u003e For client-side maps, one again generates two output files:\ndot -Tcmapx -ox.map -Tgif -ox.gif x.gv and uses the HTML\n\u003cIMG SRC=\"x.gif\" USEMAP=\"#mainmap\" /\u003e ... [content of x.map] ... Note that the name given in the USEMAP attribute must be the same as the ID attribute of the MAP element. The Graphviz renderer uses the name of the graph as the ID. Thus, in the example above, where the graph's name is mainmap, we have USEMAP=\"#mainmap\" in the IMG attribute, and x.map will look like\n\u003cmap id=\"mainmap\" name=\"mainmap\"\u003e ... \u003c/map\u003e URLs can be attached to the root graph, nodes and edges. If a node has a URL, clicking in the node will activate the link. If an edge has a URL, various points along the edge (but not necessarily the head or tail) will link to it. In addition, if the edge has a label, that will link to the URL. As for the head of the edge, this is linked to the headURL, if set. Otherwise, it is linked to the edge's URL if that is defined. The analogous description holds for the tail and the tailURL. A URL associated with the graph is used as a default link.\nIf the URL of a node contains the escape sequence \\N, it will be replaced by the node's name. If the headURL is defined and contains the escape sequence \\N, it will be replaced by the headlabel, if defined.

At present, edges are ignored during packing. Packing is done using the standard packing functions. In particular, the graph attributes pack and packmode control the layout. Each graph and cluster can specify its own values for these attributes.

This guarantees an edge-node overlap will not be mistaken for an edge ending at a node.\nOn the other hand, usually for aesthetic reasons, it may be desirable that all edges appear beneath nodes, even if the resulting drawing is ambiguous. This can be achieved by choosing \"edgesfirst\".\n","categories":"","description":"The order in which nodes and edges are drawn in output.","excerpt":"The order in which nodes and edges are drawn in output.","ref":"/docs/attr-types/outputMode/","tags":"","title":"outputMode"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Specify order in which nodes and edges are drawn","excerpt":"Specify order in which nodes and edges are drawn","ref":"/docs/attrs/outputorder/","tags":"","title":"outputorder"},{"body":"Nodes are first enlarged using the sep attribute. If true , overlaps are retained. If the value is \"scale\", overlaps are removed by uniformly scaling in x and y. If the value converts to \"false\", and it is available, Prism, a proximity graph-based algorithm, is used to remove node overlaps. This can also be invoked explicitly with overlap=prism. This technique starts with a small scaling up, controlled by the overlap_scaling attribute, which can remove a significant portion of the overlap. The prism option also accepts an optional non-negative integer suffix. This can be used to control the number of attempts made at overlap removal. By default, overlap=\"prism\" is equivalent to overlap=\"prism1000\". Setting overlap=\"prism0\" causes only the scaling phase to be run.\nIf Prism is not available, or the version of Graphviz is earlier than 2.28, \"overlap=false\" uses a Voronoi-based technique. This can always be invoked explicitly with \"overlap=voronoi\".\nIf overlap=\"scalexy\", x and y are separately scaled to remove overlaps.\nIf overlap=\"compress\", the layout will be scaled down as much as possible without introducing any overlaps, obviously assuming there are none to begin with.\nN.B. The remaining allowed values of overlap correspond to algorithms which, at present, can produce bad aspect ratios. In addition, we deprecate the use of the \"ortho*\" and \"portho*\".\nIf the value is \"vpsc\", overlap removal is done as a quadratic optimization to minimize node displacement while removing node overlaps.\nIf the value is \"orthoxy\" or \"orthoyx\", overlaps are moved by optimizing two constraint problems, one for the x axis and one for the y. The suffix indicates which axis is processed first. If the value is \"ortho\", the technique is similar to \"orthoxy\" except a heuristic is used to reduce the bias between the two passes. If the value is \"ortho_yx\", the technique is the same as \"ortho\", except the roles of x and y are reversed. The values \"portho\", \"porthoxy\", \"porthoxy\", and \"portho_yx\" are similar to the previous four, except only pseudo-orthogonal ordering is enforced.\nIf the layout is done by neato with mode=\"ipsep\", then one can use overlap=ipsep. In this case, the overlap removal constraints are incorporated into the layout algorithm itself. N.B. At present, this only supports one level of clustering.\nExcept for fdp and sfdp, the layouts assume overlap=\"true\" as the default. Fdp first uses a number of passes using a built-in, force-directed technique to try to remove overlaps. Thus, fdp accepts overlap with an integer prefix followed by a colon, specifying the number of tries. If there is no prefix, no initial tries will be performed. If there is nothing following a colon, none of the above methods will be attempted. By default, fdp uses overlap=\"9:prism\". Note that overlap=\"true\", overlap=\"0:true\" and overlap=\"0:\" all turn off all overlap removal.\nBy default, sfdp uses overlap=\"prism0\".\nExcept for the Voronoi and prism methods, all of these transforms preserve the orthogonal ordering of the original layout. That is, if the x coordinates of two nodes are originally the same, they will remain the same, and if the x coordinate of one node is originally less than the x coordinate of another, this relation will still hold in the transformed layout. The similar properties hold for the y coordinates. This is not quite true for the \"porth*\" cases. For these, orthogonal ordering is only preserved among nodes related by an edge.\n","categories":"","description":"Determines if and how node overlaps should be removed","excerpt":"Determines if and how node overlaps should be removed","ref":"/docs/attrs/overlap/","tags":"","title":"overlap"},{"body":"When overlap=prism, the layout is scaled by this factor, thereby removing a fair amount of node overlap, and making node overlap removal faster and better able to retain the graph's shape.\nIf overlap_scaling is negative, the layout is scaled by -1*overlap_scaling times the average label size.\nIf overlap_scaling is positive, the layout is scaled by overlap_scaling.\nIf overlap_scaling is zero, no scaling is done.\n","categories":"","description":"Scale layout by factor, to reduce node overlap.","excerpt":"Scale layout by factor, to reduce node overlap.","ref":"/docs/attrs/overlap_scaling/","tags":"","title":"overlap_scaling"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Whether the overlap removal algorithm should perform a compression pass to reduce the size of the layout","excerpt":"Whether the overlap removal algorithm should perform a compression …","ref":"/docs/attrs/overlap_shrink/","tags":"","title":"overlap_shrink"},{"body":"If pack has an integral value, this is used as the size, in points,of a margin around each part; otherwise, a default margin of 8 is used.\nIf pack is interpreted as false, the entire graph is laid out together.

A value of \"node\" causes packing at the node and edge level, with no overlapping of these objects. This produces a layout with the least area, but it also allows interleaving, where a node of one component may lie between two nodes in another component. A value of \"graph\" does a packing using the bounding box of the component. Thus, there will be a rectangular region around a component free of elements of any other component. A value of \"clust\" guarantees that top-level clusters are kept intact. What effect a value has also depends on the layout algorithm. For example, neato does not support clusters, so a value of \"clust\" will have the same effect as the default \"node\" value.\nThe mode \"array(_flag)?(%d)?\" indicates that the components should be packed at the graph level into an array of graphs. By default, the components are in row-major order, with the number of columns roughly the square root of the number of components. If the optional flags contains 'c', then column-major order is used. Finally, if the optional integer suffix is used, this specifies the number of columns for row-major or the number of rows for column-major. Thus, the mode \"array_c4\" indicates array packing, with 4 rows, starting in the upper left and going down the first column, then down the second column, etc., until all components are used.\nIf a graph is smaller than the array cell it occupies, it is centered by default. The optional flags may contain 't', 'b', 'l', or 'r', indicating that the graphs should be aligned along the top, bottom, left or right, respectively.\nIf the optional flags contains 'u', this causes the insertion order of elements in the array to be determined by user-supplied values. Each component can specify its sort value by a non-negative integer using the sortv attribute. Components are inserted in order, starting with the one with the smallest sort value.

Note that all graph, node and edge coordinates and lengths are given unscaled. node The name value is the name of the node, and x and y give the node's position. The width and height are the width and height of the node. The label, style, shape, color and fillcolor give the node's label, style, shape, color and fillcolor, respectively, using attribute default values where necessary. If the node does not have a style attribute, \"solid\" is used. edge The tail and head values give the names of the head and tail nodes. In plain-ext format, the head or tail name will be appended with a colon and a portname if the edge connects to the node at a port. n is the number of control points defining the B-spline forming the edge. This is followed by 2*n numbers giving the x and y coordinates of the control points in order from tail to head. If the edge has a label, this comes next followed by the x and y coordinates of the label's position. The edge description is completed by the edge's style and color. As with nodes, if a style is not defined, \"solid\" is used. Note: The control points given in an edge statement define the body of the edge. In particular, if the edge has an arrowhead to the head or tail node, there will be a gap between the last or first control points and the boundary of the associated node. There are at least 3 possible ways of handling this gap:\nArrange that the input graph uses dir=none, arrowhead=none, or arrowtail=none for all edges. In this case, the terminating control points will always touch the node. Consider the line segment joining the control point and the center of the node, and determine the point where the segment intersects the node's boundary. Then use the control point and the intersection point as the main axis of an arrowhead. The problem with this approach is that, if the edge has a port, the edge will not be pointing to the center of the node. In this case, rather than use the control point and center point, one can use the control point and its tangent. Arrange that the input graph uses headclip=false or tailclip=false. In this case, the edge will terminate at the node's center rather than its boundary. If arrowheads are used, there will still be a gap, but normally this will occur within the node. The application will still need to clip the spline to the node boundary. Also, as with the previous item, if the edge points to a node port, this technique will fail. The output consists of one graph line, a sequence of node lines, one per node, a sequence of edge lines, one per edge, and a final stop line. All units are in inches, represented by a floating point number.\nNote that the plain formats provide minimal information, really giving not much more than node positions and sizes, and edge spline control points. These formats are usually most useful to applications wanting just this geometric information, and willing to fill in all of the graphical details. The only real advantages to these formats is their terseness and their ease of parsing. In general, the dot and xdot are preferable in terms of the quantity of information provided.\n","categories":"","description":"Simple, line-based language","excerpt":"Simple, line-based language","ref":"/docs/outputs/plain/","tags":"","title":"Plain Text"},{"body":"Produces output in the PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format.\n(25 November 2014) A standard Graphviz installation will render using both the Cairo and GD library.

Then, when rendered, the layout will be scaled down uniformly in both dimensions to fit the given size, which may cause nodes and text to shrink as well.

The colors are specified via a colorList, the colors drawn from left to right in list order. Optional color weights can be specified to indicate the proportional widths of the bars. If the sum of the weights is less than 1, the remainder is divided evenly among the colors with no weight. Note: The style \"striped\" is only supported with clusters and rectangularly-shaped nodes.\nThe style \"wedged\" causes the fill to be done as a set of wedges. The colors are specified via a colorList, with the colors drawn counter-clockwise starting at angle 0. Optional color weights are interpreted analogously to the striped case described above. Note: The style \"wedged\" is allowed only for elliptically-shaped nodes.\nThe following tables illustrate some of the effects of the style settings. Examples of tapered line styles are given below. Examples of linear and radial gradient fill can be seen under colorList.\nBasic style settings for nodes solid dashed dotted bold rounded diagonals filled striped wedged Basic style settings for edges solid dashed dotted bold Basic style settings for clusters solid dashed dotted bold rounded filled striped The effect of style=tapered depends on the penwidth, dir, arrowhead and arrowtail attributes. The edge starts with width penwidth and tapers to width 1, in points. The dir attribute determines whether the tapering goes from tail to head (dir=forward), from head to tail (dir=forward), from the middle to both the head and tail (dir=both), or no tapering at all (dir=none). If the dir is not explicitly set, the default for the graph type is used (see dir). Arrowheads and arrowtails are also drawn, based on the value of dir; to avoid this, set arrowhead and/or arrowtail to \"none\".\nNote: At present, the tapered style only allows a simple filled polygon. Additional styles such as dotted or dashed, or multiple colors supplied via a colorList are ignored.\nThe following table illustrates the style=tapered with penwidth=7 and arrowtail=none.\ndir \\ arrowhead normal none forward back both none Additional styles are available in device-dependent form. Style lists are passed to device drivers, which can use this to generate appropriate output.\nThe style attribute affects the basic appearance of nodes, edges and graphs, but has no effect on any text used in labels. For this, use the fontname, fontsize and fontcolor attributes, or the \u003cFONT\u003e, \u003cB\u003e, \u003cI\u003e, etc. elements in HTML-like labels.\nThe setlinewidth style value can be used for more control over the width of node borders and edges than is allowed by bold.

For example, an unfilled node with no drawn boundary will only be active on its label. For other output, the active area is its bounding box. The active area for a cluster is its bounding box. For edges, the active areas are small circles where the edge contacts its head and tail nodes. In addition, for svg, cmapx and imap, the active area includes a thin polygon approximating the edge. The circles may overlap the related node, and the edge URL dominates. If the edge has a label, this will also be active.

This will download all submodules, which are mostly the dependencies for the Windows build. Next, add the windows\\dependencies\\graphviz-build-utilities directory to your PATH (and restart Visual Studio or the prompt with which you execute msbuild after that). This folder contains the tools Bison, Flex and SED (and future additions) with versions that are tested. If all went right, the dependencies are now set up and you can build Graphviz.\n(Graphviz versions ≥ 2.30)\nThe current build process for Windows using Visual Studio is fairly simple assuming all of the necessary files are available and have been put in the correct place. The build assumes you have installed binary versions of GTK 2.0 or later, Qt, and ltdl, and source versions of GTS and ann. Further instructions can be found in the Graphviz gitlab repository.\nThis whole process could and should be simplified. In particular, the 3rd-party software should not be stored in two places, and the Graphviz files that are made part of the release should come from the source package, and not be stored separately. In addition, the GTS and ANN build should be separate from the Graphviz build. As 3rd-party libraries, these should only be built when the source is updated.\n(Graphviz versions ≥ 2.22)\nWe now build both Visual Studio and MinGW versions of Graphviz. In addition, the source package comes with project files for Visual Studio, so building from source should be fairly simple in either case.\nThe first step is to add the third-party libraries. These are listed here. This is most easily done by installing a Windows binary version of GTK 2.0 or later. Next, download and unwrap the Graphviz source package, and copy over either the stable release or the development source package. Let $ROOT be the root directory (folder) in which you stored the Graphviz source.\nBuilding with Visual Studio Copy the file $ROOT/windows/config.h into $ROOT. Copy the folder $ROOT/windows/FEATURE into $ROOT. Start Visual Studio and read in $ROOT/graphviz.sln. There are project files for all of the parts of Graphviz. Modify the various settings for include file and library directories to find the third-party software. Modify the settings as to where you want the software installed. Build Graphviz. Building with MinGW Install MinGW and Msys. This gives a mini GNU-like compile environment\nSet environment variables based on your machine, giving values to the first six below:\nexport INSTALLROOT # Root install directory export GTKDIR # Root of GTK tree export FONTCONFIGINCLUDEDIR # Path of fontconfig include dir export FONTCONFIGLIBDIR # Path of fontconfig lib dir export FREETYPEINCLUDEDIR # Path of freetype2 include dir export FREETYPELIBDIR # Path of freetype2 lib dir export CFLAGS=\"-DGVDLL=1\" export CPPFLAGS=\"-I$GTKDIR/include -I$GTKDIR/include/freetype2 \" export LDFLAGS=\"-L$GTKDIR/lib -no-undefined\" export FONTCONFIG_CFLAGS=-I$GTKDIR/include/ export FONTCONFIG_LIBS=\"-L$FONTCONFIGLIBDIR -lfontconfig\" export FREETYPE2_CFLAGS=-I$FREETYPEINCLUDEDIR export FREETYPE2_LIBS=-L$FREETYPELIBDIR export PKG_CONFIG=$GTKDIR/bin/pkg-config export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$GTKDIR/lib/pkgconfig export PANGOFLAGS=\"--with-fontconfig --with-fontconfiglibdir=$FONTCONFIGLIBDIR --with-fontconfigincludedir=$FONTCONFIGINCLUDEDIR --with-pangocairo\" Change directory to $ROOT and run configure:\n./configure -C --prefix=$INSTALLROOT --without-gdk-pixbuf --with-mylibgd --disable-swig --without-x --disable-tcl --without-ipsepcola --enable-shared --disable-static --with-freetype=$GTKDIR/lib --enable-ltdl $PANGOFLAGS --without-gtk --without-gtkgl When configure finishes, it lists all of the Graphviz features that have been enabled. If there are problems, you can check for errors in config.log. You may have to add or modify other flags and environment variables for configure to give you the settings you want. Run configure --help to see the allowed options and environment variables.\nRun make\nRun make install\nThese builds create a feature-full version of Graphviz. You can tailor them to your wants. This is fairly simple for MinGW: just remove or reset the flag of the option you don't want. For Visual Studio, you will probably need to reset some of the values in config.h and some of the compile-time options.\n(2.21 \u003e= Graphviz versions \u003e 2.14)\nTo simplify our build process, especially as most Windows users only want a binary version of the software, the Graphviz build for Windows now uses uwin, an open-source Unix layer on top of Windows. In this environment, we can use essentially the same tools and process used on Unix. In particular, we do not have to maintain multiple build files.\nTo build Graphviz:\nInstall the third-party libraries. This is most easily done by installing a Windows binary verion of GTK 2.0 or later.\nDownload the Graphviz source package, and copy over either the stable release graphviz-VERSION.tar.gz or the development source package graphviz-working.tar.gz.\nUnwrap the package:\nYou can use, for example,\ngunzip \u003c graphviz-working.tar.gz | tar xf - Let $ROOT be the directory in which you stored the Graphviz source.\nConfigure the package for your system:\ncd $ROOT configure --disable-shared --enable-static --with-mylibgd --disable-swig --without-x --without-tclsh --with-codegens --disable-ltdl You will probably want to provide additional arguments to configure to indicate where you have installed GTK, where you want the results installed (--prefix) and which additional optional packages you want built. Run configure --help to see the available set of arguments.\nBuild Graphviz:\nmake install Presumably, a similar approach would work with Cygwin or MinGW. The following are some notes by Steve Roush describing how he made a static build of the libraries on MinGW.\nInstall MinGW and Msys. This gives a mini GNU-like compile environment that produces Windows-compatible results.\nYou may need to configure and build in Windows \"Safe mode\". Try ./configure in normal mode; if it dies with \"fork\" problems, use Safe mode.\nEdit the \"configure\" file. after this line:\nDEFS=-DHAVE_CONFIG_H add these lines:\ncase \"$host_os\" in mingw*) DEFS=\"$DEFS -DMSWIN32\" ;; esac run configure:\n./configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-libgd=no --enable-ltdl=no --disable-swig --disable-sharp --disable-guile --disable-io --disable-java --disable-lua --disable-ocaml --disable-perl --disable-php --disable-python --disable-ruby --disable-tcl edit lib/Makefile\nreplace these lines:\nSUBDIRS = cdt graph agraph gd pathplan agutil sfio vmalloc ast vpsc \\ circogen dotgen fdpgen neatogen twopigen common pack gvc \\ ingraphs expr with these lines:\nSUBDIRS = cdt graph agraph gd pathplan vpsc \\ circogen dotgen fdpgen neatogen twopigen common pack gvc \\ ingraphs make # builds most of \"lib\" (see Makefile changes), cmd/dot and cmd/tools - stops on cmd/gvpr make install here is the command line I used to build simple.c, after adding a few lines based on https://mailman.research.att.com/pipermail/graphviz-interest/2006q2/003586.html\nX=simple;gcc -v -I'/usr/local/include/graphviz' -I'/usr/local/include' -o $X -O $X.c -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/graphviz -lgvc -lgraph -lpathplan -lcdt -lgvplugin_core -lgvplugin_dot_layout -lgvplugin_neao_layout -lgvplugin_gd -lgvplugin_pango -lgvc -lpathplan If you desire to build directly using Visual Studio or other non-Unix-based environment, you will need to derive the necessary information from the supplied Makefiles.\n(2.14 \u003e= Graphviz versions \u003e= 2.3)\nWe build Graphviz on Windows using the MS Visual C++ 6.0 compiler only. The simplest way to build the software from source on Windows is as follows:\nDownload the Windows source package.\nUnwrap the package:\nIf you have Unix tools available, you can use\ngunzip \u003c graphviz-win.tgz | tar xf - If not, double click on the file and WinZip should start up and let you store all of the files into a directory.\nLet $ROOT be the directory in which you stored the Graphviz source.\nAdd the third-party libraries:\nzlib 1.1.3 http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ libpng 1.0.6 http://www.libpng.org/pub/png jpeg-6b 62 http://www.ijg.org/ freetype 2.1.7 http://freetype.sourceforge.net/ expat http://expat.sourceforge.net/ The versions should be at least the ones indicated. You can download the files from https://www.graphviz.org/Misc/third-party.zip. Unzip the package in the $ROOT directory; this will create a subdirectory called third-party. Or you can obtain the libraries yourself, and install them in $ROOT\\third-party Also note that these libraries come with the binary release.\nBuild the software in one of the following ways:\nRun the script $ROOT\\build.bat while in the $ROOT directory. You'll first want to check that the vc variable points to your local installation of visual C. Obviously, this should be run in a DOS command window.\nThe file $ROOT\\ws\\graphviz.dsw is the main workspace for the Graphviz libraries and graph drawing programs. The file $ROOT\\ws\\tools.dsw provides the workspace for the additional Graphviz tools. Double-clicking on these files will open the workspaces using the MS Visual Studio, from which you can use the Build menu item to create the various libraries and programs.\nNote that we have avoided all dependencies (i.e., there are no .dep files) because we found they tended to include absolute pathnames. If necessary, follow the order used in build.bat to be safe.\nIf you have a Unix environment, with a real ksh, run the script $ROOT\\wmake.sh after setting the PATH, LIB and INCLUDE shell variables to the paths where the Visual C programs are installed on your machine, and the associated library and include file directories.\nOnce built, all of the libraries and programs will be found in either the Release or Debug subdirectory of the corresponding source directory. If you wish to install the software somewhere, edit the file $ROOT\\install.bat to set the variable root to be the absolute pathname of the directory where you want the software installed, and then run the script $ROOT\\install.bat from the $ROOT directory.\nIf you want to change source files, you can just do it and rebuild. If, however, you want to add new files or projects, you will have to redo the makefiles or scripts.\nIf you have problems or questions, please contact us at erg@research.att.com.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"For building on Windows:\n(Graphviz versions ≥ 2.41)\nFirst, in the root …","ref":"/doc/winbuild.html","tags":"","title":"Windows"},{"body":"This is a graph from Forrester's book World Dynamics.

The semantics of these are described below.\nLayout void xxx_layout(Agraph_t * g) Initialize the graph.\nIf the algorithm will use the common edge routing code, it should call setEdgeType (g, ...);.\nFor each node, call common_init_node and gv_nodesize.\nIf the algorithm will use spline_edges() to route the edges, the node coordinates need to be stored in ND_pos, so this should be allocated here. This, and the two calls mentioned above, are all handled by a call to neato_init_node().\nFor each edge, call common_init_edge.\nThe algorithm should allocate whatever other data structures it needs. This can involve fields in the A*info_t fields. In addition, each of these fields contains a void* alg; subfield that the algorithm can use the store additional data. Once we move to cgraph, this will all be replaced with algorithm specific records.\nLayout the graph. When finished, each node should have its coordinates stored in points in ND_coord_i(n), each edge should have its layout described in ED_spl(e). (N.B. As of version 2.21, ND_coord_i has been replaced by ND_coord, which are now floating point coordinates.)\nTo add edges, there are 3 functions available:\nspline_edges1 (Agraph_t*, int edgeType) Assumes the node coordinates are stored in ND_coord_i, and that GD_bb is set. For each edge, this function constructs the appropriate data and stores it in ED_spl. spline_edges0 (Agraph_t*) Assumes the node coordinates are stored in ND_pos, and that GD_bb is set. This function uses the ratio attribute if set, copies the values in ND_pos to ND_coord_i (converting from inches to points); and calls spline_edges1 using the edge type specified by setEdgeType(). spline_edges (Agraph_t*) Assumes the node coordinates are stored in ND_pos. This function calculates the bounding box of g and stores it in GD_bb, then calls spline_edges0(). If the algorithm only works with connected components, the code can use the pack library to get components, lay them out individually, and pack them together based on user specifications. A typical schema is given below. One can look at the code for twopi, circo, neato or fdp for more detailed examples.\nAgraph_t **ccs; Agraph_t *sg; Agnode_t *c = NULL; int ncc; int i; ccs = ccomps(g, \u0026ncc, 0); if (ncc == 1) { /* layout nodes of g */ adjustNodes(g); /* if you need to remove overlaps */ spline_edges(g); /* generic edge routing code */ } else { pack_info pinfo; pack_mode pmode = getPackMode(g, l_node); for (i = 0; i \u003c ncc; i++) { sg = ccs[i]; /* layout sg */ adjustNodes(sg); /* if you need to remove overlaps */ } spline_edges(g); /* generic edge routing */ /* initialize packing info, e.g. */ pinfo.margin = getPack(g, CL_OFFSET, CL_OFFSET); pinfo.doSplines = 1; pinfo.mode = pmode; pinfo.fixed = 0; packSubgraphs(ncc, ccs, g, \u0026pinfo); } for (i = 0; i \u003c ncc; i++) { agdelete(g, ccs[i]); } free(ccs); Be careful in laying of subgraphs if you rely on attributes that have only been set in the root graph. With connected components, edges can be added with each component, before packing (as above) or after the components have been packed (see circo).\nIt is good to check for trivial cases where the graph has 0 or 1 nodes, or no edges.\nAt the end of xxx_layout, call\ndotneato_postprocess(g); The following template will work in most cases, ignoring the problems of handling disconnected graphs and removing node overlaps:\nstatic void xxx_init_node(node_t * n) { neato_init_node(n); /* add algorithm-specific data, if desired */ } static void xxx_init_edge(edge_t * e) { common_init_edge(e); /* add algorithm-specific data, if desired */ } static void xxx_init_node_edge(graph_t * g) { node_t *n; edge_t *e; for (n = agfstnode(g); n; n = agnxtnode(g, n)) { xxx_init_node(n); } for (n = agfstnode(g); n; n = agnxtnode(g, n)) { for (e = agfstout(g, n); e; e = agnxtout(g, e)){ xxx_init_edge(e); } } } void xxx_layout (Agraph_t* g) { xxx_init_node_edge(g); /* Set ND_pos(n) for each node n */ spline_edges(g); dotneato_postprocess(g); } Cleanup void xxx_cleanup(Agraph_t * g) Free up any resources allocated in the layout.\nFinish with calls to gv_cleanup_node and gv_cleanup_edge for each node and edge. This cleans up splines labels, ND_pos, shapes and 0's out the A*info_t, so these have to occur last, but could be part of explicit xxx_cleanup_node and xxx_cleanup_edge, if desired.\nAt the end, you should do:\nif (g != g-\u003eroot) memset(\u0026(g-\u003eu), 0, sizeof(Agraphinfo_t)); This is necessary for the graph to be laid out again, as the layout code assumes this structure is clean.\nlibgvc does a final cleanup to the root graph, freeing any drawing, freeing its label, and zeroing out Agraphinfo_t of the root graph.\nThe following template will work in most cases:\nstatic void xxx_cleanup_graph(Agraph_t * g) { /* Free any algorithm-specific data attached to the graph */ if (g != g-\u003eroot) memset(\u0026(g-\u003eu), 0, sizeof(Agraphinfo_t)); } static void xxx_cleanup_edge (Agedge_t* e) { /* Free any algorithm-specific data attached to the edge */ gv_cleanup_edge(e); } static void xxx_cleanup_node (Agnode_t* n) { /* Free any algorithm-specific data attached to the node */ gv_cleanup_node(e); } void xxx_cleanup(Agraph_t * g) { Agnode_t *n; Agedge_t *e; for (n = agfstnode(g); n; n = agnxtnode(g, n)) { for (e = agfstout(g, n); e; e = agnxtout(g, e)) { xxx_cleanup_edge(e); } xxx_cleanup_node(n); } xxx_cleanup_graph(g); } Most layouts use auxiliary routines similar to neato, so the entry points can be added in plugin/neato_layout.\nAdd to gvlayout_neato_layout.c:\ngvlayout_engine_t xxxgen_engine = { xxx_layout, xxx_cleanup, }; and the line\n{LAYOUT_XXX, \"xxx\", 0, \u0026xxxgen_engine, \u0026neatogen_features}, to gvlayout_neato_types and a new emum LAYOUT_XXX to layout_type in that file.\nThe above allows the new layout to piggyback on top of the neato plugin, but requires rebuilding the plugin. In general, a user can (and probably should) build a layout plugin totally separately.\nTo do this, after writing xxx_layout and xxx_cleanup, it is necessary to:\nAdd the types and data structures:\ntypedef enum { LAYOUT_XXX } layout_type; static gvlayout_features_t xxxgen_features = { 0 }; gvlayout_engine_t xxxgen_engine = { xxx_layout, xxx_cleanup, }; static gvplugin_installed_t gvlayout_xxx_types[] = { {LAYOUT_XXX, \"xxx\", 0, \u0026xxxgen_engine, \u0026xxxgen_features}, {0, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL} }; static gvplugin_api_t apis[] = { {API_layout, \u0026gvlayout_xxx_types}, {(api_t)0, 0}, }; gvplugin_library_t gvplugin_xxx_layout_LTX_library = { \"xxx_layout\", apis }; Combine all of this into a dynamic library whose name contains the string gvplugin_ and install the library in the same directory as the other Graphviz plugins. For example, on Linux systems, the dot layout plugin is in the library libgvplugin_dot_layout.so.\nRun dot -c to regenerate the config file.\nNOTES:\nAdditional layouts can be added as extra lines in gvlayout_xxx_types. Obviously, most of the names and strings can be arbitrary. One constraint is that external identifier for the gvplugin_library_t type must end in _LTX_library. In addition, the string xxx in each entry of gvlayout_xxx_types is the name used to identify the layout algorithm, so needs to be distinct from any other layout name. The features of a layout algorithm are currently limited to a flag of bits, and the only flag supported is LAYOUT_USES_RANKDIR, which enables the layout to the rankdir attribute. Changes need to be made to any applications that statically know about layout algorithms.\nAutomake Configuration If you want to integrate your code into the Graphviz software and use its build system, follow the instructions below. You can certainly build and install your plugin using your own build software.\nPut your software in lib/xxxgen, and added the hooks describe above into gvlayout_neato_layout.c In lib/xxxgen, provide a Makefile.am (based on a simple example like lib/fdpgen/Makefile.am) In lib/Makefile.am, add xxxgen to SUBDIRS In configure.ac, add lib/xxxgen/Makefile to AC_CONFIG_FILES. In lib/plugin/neato_layout/Makefile.am, insert $(top_builddir)/lib/xxxgen/libxxxgen_C.la in libgvplugin_neato_layout_C_la_LIBADD. Remember to run autogen.sh because on its own configure can guess wrong. This also assumes you have a good version of the various automake tools on your system.\n","categories":"","description":"How to write a custom layout engine.","excerpt":"How to write a custom layout engine.","ref":"/docs/layouts/writing-layout-plugins/","tags":"","title":"Writing Layout Plugins"},{"body":"Creates an Xlib (X11) window and displays the output there.\nxlib is an alias for x11.\n","categories":"","description":"X11 Window","excerpt":"X11 Window","ref":"/docs/outputs/xlib/","tags":"","title":"X11"},{"body":"xdot is a custom Graphviz language invented by Emden Gansner, describing ellipses, polygons, polylines, beziers, text, images, colors, gradients, fonts, and styles.\nExample: c 7 -#ff0000 p 4 4 4 36 4 36 36 4 36 renders a red square.\nFor more information on the xdot format, see:\nxdot section of dot output format PDF Manpage parseOp function in lib/xdot/xdot.c C struct _xdot_op in lib/xdot/xdot.h ","categories":"","description":"List of graphical operations in Graphviz's `xdot` language.","excerpt":"List of graphical operations in Graphviz's `xdot` language.","ref":"/docs/attr-types/xdot/","tags":"","title":"xdot"},{"body":"Only used for xdot output.\nIf unset, graphviz will set this attribute to the xdot version used for output.\n","categories":"","description":"Determines the version of `xdot` used in output","excerpt":"Determines the version of `xdot` used in output","ref":"/docs/attrs/xdotversion/","tags":"","title":"xdotversion"},{"body":" For nodes, the label will be placed outside of the node but near it.
